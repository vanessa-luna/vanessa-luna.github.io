		<h1 class="post-title">A long overdue update. The world is a weird place</h1>
		<span class="post-date">chronograph ~ 2017-12-26</span>
		<br><br>

		<p>I have been up to so much in the last two weeks. I have hardly had time to write about it all. I will recap in this post, but I am thankful I still managed to write more than what you'll see here in a different place.</p>
<p>One of the things I noticed was how I met so many people and told so many stories I forgot who I told what and had strange moments of deja vu and poor recollection. Everything outside of now felt so distant and unimportant. I don't fully understand what that means but it means.</p>
<p>So, here's what you missed...</p>
<h2 id="reunion">Reunion</h2>
<p>I reconnected with the girl I met back in May. This was a very important reunion for me. During our first encounter she said to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don't know what you are do you?</p>
<p>"No and I like to keep it that way".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately after saying that I felt how sad it was. That I wanted to remain distant from what I am. This small part stuck with me the whole summer and played a big role in my progress.</p>
<p>Sadly, the second night we hung out I rode her motorcycle which really fucked me up and I crashed in front of her. Embarrassing for me, but she was a sweetheart about it. I am grateful for her energy, presence, and impact on me.</p>
<h2 id="busking">Busking</h2>
<p>The next day I went to St Augustine and tried busking for the first time. Before I could go out I sat in a coffee shop and tried to get psyched up. I spoke with a younger kid about programming which boosted my confidence before heading downtown. It's saturday so free parking amok.</p>
<p>I landed first at the end of St George st by the castle. I setup and started playing. IT was hard and cold. I made $18. Then I crashed for a bit and warmed up.</p>
<p>I then wandered around looking for another spot and sat next to a guy who looked like a performer. He was. Trumpet. We spoke about busking and it made me feel quite good. I found my second spot at Treasury and Charlotte. I made almost $30 this time!</p>
<p>I am so fucking proud of myself. Performing in the concert changed everything about my confidence. I am filled with joy and happiness because I can play again. I can play for me and in front of people! IT feels so fucking good.</p>
<p>After beaming, I drove out to Orlando.</p>
<h2 id="orlando">Orlando</h2>
<p>This is a whole week jammed into one. My mother had given me a week at a hotel using her timeshare for a break in the van.</p>
<p>My first day, Sunday I met up with a girl who and chatted over coffee. She told me about a trans event later that week which I was really excited to go to. While checking in to the hotel I befriended an employee who invited me to drinks that night. She is very pretty. It was quite awesome.</p>
<p>The next day, Monday, I wake up and went to a sales presentation for timeshare stuff. A challenge for me to make sure I don't get pressured to spend money. I invited the boy at the end over for pizza which was rough. Very interesting meeting people I don't really connect with. I learn a lot about myself that way.</p>
<p>Tuesday I spent a long time on the computer and mosied over downtown for ad ate with a girl I met way back in April. She canceled however so I just went back to the hotel.</p>
<p>Wednesday I relaxed more and landed at the trans event. There I met a bunch of people, drank and ate food. One girl caught my eye and we connected. So I followed her to another bar then took her back the hotel and spent time in the jacuzzi. Such a sweetheart she offered to take me to Universal Studios on Friday! Wow.</p>
<p>Thursday I finally got to meet up with my violin inspiration. The girl I met at a violin shop who I came out to because of national coming out day. Since I knew I might see her, I pushed myself to go busking before we met up. The universe clearly wanted me to go busking. It was really nice filling in more about her from the few moments we shared almost six months ago.</p>
<p>Friday I went to Universal with my friend. We walked around together and thoroughly enjoyed it. After she left for work I spent another four hours in the park pushing myself to have fun.</p>
<p>Saturday I spent lying in bed recovering. I packed up and spent a little time with the employee I met my first day. Then I landed in St Augustine so I could busk during the holiday.</p>
<h2 id="christmas">Christmas</h2>
<p>Christmas Eve I woke up in downtown St Augustine determined to make some cash. I got myself out around 11am. I setup at Hypolita and Spanish street. I got real hot in the sun and made about $20. After a break I setup at Cuna and Charlotte. I made $50 in an hour! Holy shit. After another break I setup at St Geroge and Orange st. I barely played because I hurt so bad I couldn't play anoymore.</p>
<p>This crushed me so much I hobbled back to Vanessa. I made some food and lied in bed for a really long time before going to Walmart to sleep. I hurt so badly I could barely sleep. And I didn't. I woke up at 1am even after taking my meds.</p>
<p>So we're in Christmas day now. I can't sleep so I roll over to Seven Eleven to get something to drink. The employee was so nice to me. He gave me water, ice and free food. Then I crawled over to the pier at the ocean and waited for sunrise. I fell asleep again but got woken up by the same employee bearing more food for me!</p>
<p>So I am up and watch the sunrise. It was beautiful.</p>
<p>I walked around trying to pawn all the extra pastries, but no one wanted them. Not surprising. Sugar pastries. Ya. Well I did have a good conversation with one of the men. He was really considerate and willing to offer advice.</p>
<p>I finally got out busking at Cuna and St George. I was feeling pretty good buy also very vulnerable. So many people had access to my music without needing to get close. IT was a very different feel than the other spots. But I actually got plenty of money quickly. And I was having fun. Lots of eye contact and smiles. And then...</p>
<p>The girl I messaged on OKCupid when I first got into St Augustine was standing in front of me! WHAT?! She had told me she wasn't feeling well enough to meet up in the morning so I was very surprised.</p>
<p>We had a great time together. Coffee, walking, food. It was so cool to have such a spontaneous encounter with someone who truly captivated me. I spent the night in the parking lot of her apartment and we spent the morning together too.</p>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>Woah right? I've been social like 21 of the last 23 days...</p>
<p>And the streak continues with events upcoming. So eager for the future. Thank you universe. Thank you Luna for choosing to be the way you are and fighting to make it a reality. It is precisely the way I chose to be that invites such amazing experiences. </p>
