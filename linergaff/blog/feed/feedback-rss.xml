This time to make a gaff for her and see what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OMG!!! DUDE! THIS THING IS SO PERFECT!&lt;br&gt;
I'm seriously shocked right now. This is like the tightest and most comfortable tuck I've ever had!&lt;br&gt;
Thank you so much!!!!!&lt;br&gt;
Seriously!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew. It took me a lot longer tha normal to make it so I wasn't there to get initial reactions. But I am very happy to have made another person this happy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2017-10-13:/linergaff/blog/a/2017-10-13-first-in-a-while</guid></item></channel></rss>
