&lt;p&gt;Priorities. This morning I am surrounded. Their chattering cackle drowning me in cacophony. The din begging me to answer the question: &lt;em&gt;Who are you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="info-span" style="background-color:#fff; font-size:.8rem"&gt; This post is specficially for me, without much concern for the position of others. This somehow feels different to me as I write this than other recovery posts. I hope there is still value for my readers through extrapolation&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id="dammit-why-does-it-always-boil-down-to-that-question_1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dammit, why does it always boil down to that question?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who am I? Fuck. No one likes answering that question. Well some of us. And fine, I like the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of answering it. Making the choice to be someone is a little too daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priorities are a good way of determining who someone is. What do they care about? Why do they care about? What do they spend their time thinking about? What do they do with their time? All of those questions could be answered through the lense of priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we avoid answering this existential question and still determine our priorities? How would we do that? What other frames or lenses, or, as I like to say, windows can we add to this perspective to help us decide our priorities without exhausting ourselves into existential hell? Hopefully, I work it out by the end of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-important-to-you"&gt;What is important to you?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already know what is important to me, I choose not to fight for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I know what is important to me? Feeling. Intuition. Dreams. Why do I know I am avoiding them? Because I sit on my phone allowing the habit loops of click after click create a barrier around me to protect me. A haze of moment to moment positivity which requires no effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a dream of doing something meaninful for the transgender community. I want to give something powerful, big, and impact many lives. Ever since I knew I had to transition I felt a fire raging for me to ensure no one else experiences what I did. This is important to me. It is a priority. I can't simply do it though. This kind of dream takes building, steps. Unfortunately for me, the biggest challenge I have in getting there is conquering my body. I must find a way to live inside a human body, eat drink sleep and compensate for its failings. I suck at this right now. And so one priortiy exposes another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In following this path towards a huge goal like this, other ideas and smaller priorities pop up along the way. Because of this larger goal I can plug them in to ensure my smaller priorities also in some way bring me closer to the bigger goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am to give back meaninfuly, I need to conquer my social anxiety. How will I do this? One way is for me to busk with my violin. Standing on the street playing music for strangers requires me to remain in my world thinking only of me while in the presence of others. If I am to give back I must be able to speak up for what I need given my limitations. One way to get better at that is to go on dates and spend time with new people always pushing my limits. I choose to draw out these other priorities to help me along the other. All points converging at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-am-i-still-avoiding-my-priorities"&gt;Why am I still avoiding my priorities?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I have been watching youtube and using reddit to an obscene amount, well, for my standards. Because I know I have all these things I want to do I feelt guilty and lightly ashamed when I use these services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this article because I desparately want to find my way back into inspiration and commitment. I hope by writing this down I find the outreached arm of my dreams and grab hold again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quote I found suggested this idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't say &lt;code&gt;I don't have time&lt;/code&gt; say &lt;code&gt;It is not a priority&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool. Okay, so "I don't have time to do this thing" really means "I am not prioritizing this thing". I don't have time to make my bed really means making my bed is not a priority. If it was a priority you would find a way. But I can also look at this another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have time. Period. Life is short. Weeks fly by. Months are gone and next year is already here. I get to Jacksonville and feel releived to know I plan to spend 6 weeks here only to realize I have so much planned I cannot afford to rest. What the heck!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a priority. I need to tell myself this, not in hoping to determine my priorities, but to remind myself of what NOT to do, because I already know them. I already know what my priorities are and I am getting bogged down by all the junk that means nothing to me. The habits that drain me of my life, that rob me of my goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels to me, by framing these two phrases this way I am putting myself in the window of someone who &lt;code&gt;does&lt;/code&gt; know know their priorities rather than always triyng to determine if they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-know-my-priorities"&gt;I know my priorities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat better and drink more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise and conquer my body's pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get better at the violin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take care of and improve Vanessa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read books and craft things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conquer identity issues and anxieties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the way I will give back to the trans community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything I do must help me towards one of these goals. Otherwise what am I doing? There is no mystery for me. There is no hemming or hawing over what I want. I know. And I am going to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No such thing as spare time, &lt;br&gt;
no such thing as free time,&lt;br&gt;
no such thing as down time,&lt;br&gt;
there is only life time.&lt;br&gt;
Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-11-16:/posts/2018-11-16-priorities-part1.html</guid></item><item><title>Finding Anger</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-11-11-finding-anger.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It is time I find anger again. I hate to say it. And I hate anger. I don't like it, I don't like feeling it, and I have been pretty good at not needing it for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have known for some time I need anger. For years I have been confronted time and time again where anger would have served me well. All these years avoiding anger has led me to believe this about anger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anger is one of the clearest expressions of ego and sense of self&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all emotions, anger tends to come when empathy is way down, and someone reacts purely based off their own narrative, their own perspective. Anger, in most cases seems to say &lt;code&gt;"I care about me and my world more than anything else right now"&lt;/code&gt;. Maybe this is simply a reaction to my own struggle iwth life. There are likely many forms of anger and ways to describe it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-must-i-find-anger"&gt;Why must I find anger?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I have concluded the same thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me to succeed I must fix my body&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to fix my body I must learn to be angry about my pain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current and lifelong response to my pain has always been to shrivel. To retreat from the pain, the sadness, and avoid everything. This will not work for me if I am to conquer the pain. I have to be angry when I hurt too much. And then I have to use that anger to get up and fix it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to find this anger because it hides behind some of the core struggles I have with my past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I hate what I am
I hate my pain
I hate my history
I hate being trans
I hate being smart
I hate being &amp;quot;pretty&amp;quot;
I hate human expression
I hate human behavior
I hate culture
I hate life
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These ideas live inside me like a rodent. Festering and spreading feces all over impossible to catch beyond the right bait and trap. How can I be angry when I do not truly honestly give a shit? How can I be angry when I lost my sense of self at such a young age? You telling me I have to &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; a self? Fuck that, how do I even fucking decide who to be then if I can be anything? The whole game is so fucking pathetic and lame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My anger will only come once I actually care about my life. Whatever that fucking is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still live for others. I must. Because it is the only real reason I can justify liviing right now. Most of the time that is enough. Fine. My life matters more to others than to me, and they would be sad if I left, so live. Fine. Trying to find a reason for myself is still elusive. I live in Vanessa hoping to find it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plainly do not think I will find my anger until I find a reason to live for myself. And who ever really finds a reason to live for their self? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="heres-to-hoping-i-figure-it-out"&gt;Here's to hoping I figure it out&lt;/h4&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-11-11:/posts/2018-11-11-finding-anger.html</guid></item><item><title>"What is real?" asked the Rabbit?</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-11-08-velveteen-rabbit.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"What is real?"&lt;/code&gt; Asked the Rabbit one day, when they were sitting side by side near the nursery, before Nana came to today the room. &lt;code&gt;"Does it mean having thoughts that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Real isn't how you are made"&lt;/code&gt; said the Skin Horse. &lt;code&gt;"It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long long time, not just to play with you, but really loves you, then you become real".&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Does it hurt?"&lt;/code&gt; Asked the Rabbit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Sometimes"&lt;/code&gt; said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. &lt;code&gt;"When you are real you don't mind being hurt."&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"&lt;/code&gt; he asked, &lt;code&gt;"or bit by bit?"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"It doesn't happen all at once,"&lt;/code&gt; said the Skin Horse. &lt;code&gt;"You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are real you can't be ugly except to people who don't understand."&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"I suppose you are real?"&lt;/code&gt; Said the rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the skin horse only smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"The boy's uncle made me real"&lt;/code&gt; he said. &lt;code&gt;"That was a great many years ago; but once you are real you can't become unreal again. It lasts for always".&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rabbit sighed. He thought it would be a long time before this magic called real would happen to him. He longed to become real, to know what it felt like; and yet the idea of growing shabby and losing his eyes and whiskers was rather sad. He wished that he could become it without these uncomfortable things happening to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts"&gt;thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this in &lt;a class="external" href="https://shop.amandapalmer.net/collections/misc/products/art-of-asking-book"&gt;Amanda Palmer's book "The Art of Asking"&lt;/a&gt;. She uses these quotes from the Velveteen Rabbit near the end of her book to drive home one of the central ideas of the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming real, breaking away from fear, learning to be a whole-hearted human takes effort, time, and most of all love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us are not so lucky to be born real. We all must truly learn this. You do not need to suffer from depersonalization/derealization to not be real. I've been so lucky to have even a cisgender friend talk about her becoming a real person at almost 30 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It almost seems like we all experience a form of unreality until we figure it out. For some it is like DPDR, others, its a shallow existence essentially riding the rails of life, others a subtle fear keeps you in line, and so many other ways to not feel real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I want to make sure is clear, is that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-child-who-needs-to-really-love-you-in-order-to-become-real-is-yourself"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the child who needs to really love you in order to become real is yourself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Nov 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-11-08:/posts/2018-11-08-velveteen-rabbit.html</guid></item><item><title>An update to my dissociation</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-11-06-dissociation-update.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a mess of a writing. I have been talking with others about dissociation. And I have been paying more attention to the role it plays in my life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-am-real-no-doubt-about-that"&gt;I am real. No doubt about that.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I am still not done. I am not fully me. I need to keep building who I am. Right now I find myself dissociation in the only arena that truly matters: When I meet new people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I notice how my personality, my expression clams up like crazy around new people. Still timid about rejection sure. Those I am more interested in pose a greater threat. More so, I am afraid to make choices with consequences. Because I don't yet know who I am I clam up and feel disconnected when I need to make those decisions with new people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondarily, is the issue of how much "help" a person needs. When it is clear to me the person I am with is struggling with something, I easily bring out my &lt;code&gt;i n s p i r a t i o n&lt;/code&gt; and fill the interaction with it. However when someone doesn't obviously need that I don't really know who I want to be. In this insecurity I again clam up and feel removed. I am shy, reserved, and timid to take any steps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="progress-though"&gt;progress though&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I am making progress. I have examples where I have been the one to take a step forward. To ask for something I want and see what happens. To say something about a person which may be hurtful or amazing with not a clear answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggle the most around the issue of sexuality and intimacy. I clearly want that. But I am not yet sure on what terms, and how I want it to happen. I need touch, but am always afraid of asking for it. I tell myself I would rather build a strong network of people who like and respect me, than to potentially lose alliances in the name of sex. Sex after all isn't that important to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="non-disruptive-dissociation"&gt;non-disruptive dissociation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I still expereince episodes of disconnection, they do not bother me so. Because I am still real. I am not dissociating into depersonalization, but retreating due to fear. And fear, is the entire beast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently with an older friend who has had one hell of a life. He's lived in many countries, had successfull life, relationships, and freedom of expression. He makes it painfully clear how someone with a less shameful/fearful childhood cannot truly grasp the struggle of fighting through DPDR. Sometimes it really hurts to listen to his stories. Sometimes it hurts even more when he tries to give me answers which are not so easy for me to perform. My foundation is different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is the point. My starting point is fundamentally different than people without a lifelong history of DPDR. My basement, my foundation starts there. And this is what I must carry with me as I build the mansion on top of it. I will always be fighting it in some sense. Thankfully I can see the end of the build. The mansion is complete and I rarely am effected by the roots. I have already seen so much progress. And I know in another five years or so I will be drastically different. I will conquer the effects of my foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just gotta keep fighting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 06 Nov 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-11-06:/posts/2018-11-06-dissociation-update.html</guid></item><item><title>Goodbye support group</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-09-12-bye-support-group.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am leaving Massachusetts again. For many reasons I now live in a van and stay where it is warm. This should be the first year I am able to spend the entire winter in the south, ideally never touching cold weather at all. I am very excited to get back on the road. I have many people across the east coast whom I care about, there are so many places I would like to see, and I find the pressures to stay away from digital life a peaceful feeling. I did not expect to spend so much time in MA this year but I am glad I did, and in some ways, I am sad to be leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned so much from the people I have connected with. I have felt new feelings and learned how to process them. I was pushed to step in ways I wasn't prepared for. And I am so greatful to all those who have stood with me and watched the days role by. I will miss you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-love-the-trans-community-in-ways-we-find-it-too-cliche-to-allow-cis-people-to-claim"&gt;I love the trans community, in ways we find it too cliche to allow cis people to claim.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love it for the foritude, courage, and conviction it takes to make your own terms for life. I say fuck your world, I am going to live in mine. You don't have to live in the cis-het consumerist shameful disconnected digital world that's shoved at us. While I may hope everyone finds their own way into their own world, I have little patience for the cis people who are so resistant. So I focus on my siblings who are hurting so badly from a dissonance that can sometimes take decades to understand. To help them let go of the world our pupetteers have been smothering us with and accept a new world in spite of the shame you think it bears. The shame is not in being trans. The shame is being so afraid of change and freedom you would push others to conform. Fuck shame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I spent so much time at my local support group. I feel lucky. I found my path to overcoming the majority of my traumas and anxieties. I am not done, but I have done the bulk of the work. I also spent most of my life helping others heal and take great pleasure in watching others transform into happier healthier people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is hard. Remaking your own world. Letting go of previous hopes. Finding any hope amongst a pit of despair. Falling down and getting back up over and over again. It sucks. And I promise you it will always kind of suck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-silly-advice"&gt;The silly advice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became a lot easier for me to transition when I began zooming out on my life and looking at it from a distance. To take a grander shape of my own life and step back from the minutiae of my weekly life. I forced myself to look at my life in terms of the seasons, the moon cycles, the number of weddings I might go to. I began looking at my life in terms of chapters in a book. Which chapter am I reading/writing right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I tried to plan the next chapter? What if I envision a future version of me who's a little bit farther ahead then me and ask "How did that person get from where I am today to where they are next year?" Work back from the future to find the steps and write it down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;
                &lt;iframe width="100%" height="100%"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q9WZtxRWieM'
                    frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen
                    allowFullScreen&gt;
                &lt;/iframe&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what good is all that if you can't find any single moment of joy today? While I seem broken now that's not going to stop me from relishing the fact that I'm going to take steps forward. To prevent me from finding joy in as many moments as possible. To laugh at myself when I goof up. I only get to go through this once. And when I look back on it I hope I found a way to smile sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-09-12:/posts/2018-09-12-bye-support-group.html</guid></item><item><title>Context is Queen</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-09-09-context-the-beginning.html</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context is everything. Context is the distance between everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now you have a certain way of framing the world, a certain perception of how everything works, a certain window if you will, on the world. This is your context. Everyone has their own context. Their own window on the world. The combination of biology, birthplace, age, experiences, education, relationships, all help determine the context of each person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change your context and you change your world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways of changing your context. This concept is so damn broad. Some things about your context you cannot change. Where you were born, your past, your age. Some things are harder to change, biology. Some things are easier to change, current relationships, education, active experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-greatest-tools-you-have-to-trying-to-change-your-context-are-imagination-and-curiosity"&gt;The greatest tools you have to trying to change your context are: Imagination and Curiosity.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity is marked by asking questions. Ask new questions, old questions, and silly questions. Asking questions helps you investigate new possible answers. Your brain goes off on an expedition hoping to create an answer to your question. The more you explore new answers the more you open yourself up to existing in a new context. Seeking others answers does not work as well. It is the internal process of creating your own answers that has a greater impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagination is the tool you use to create a vision for yourself. The vision of how you might recover, what it might look like, who you want to be when you recover. Imagine the future you, happy, content, REAL, and look back in time to the process you took. Imagine what future you had to do in order to get real. Take the steps backward and build a path from today to that future you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="start-building-a-new-context-using-themes-of-acceptance-as-its-foundation"&gt;Start building a new context using themes of acceptance as its foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have improper expectations about how recovery works. This leads to impatience, disappointment, and lots of dejection. However, if you start by learning about, exploring ideas, about what recovery is really like, you can help yourself right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn about how recovery is not a straight line, but a squiggly mess. Learn how to be okay with the fact that today this is where you are, and it is okay because you are committed to taking tiny steps forward. Every week you come up with a tiny step to take and see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find symbols and imagery to remind you how long and weird recovery is. You tape them to your walls, and beat into your head these new thoughts. When you stumble you don't think One step forward two steps back, you think, Yeah, it's hard to fight old habits and today I didn't win this round. That's okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep exploring how other people understand recovery. Try to really see the issue from their context. If you find a major plateau, progress stops for too long, too far a slip back, its okay. Take a step out and try to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-deeper-thought-on-context-and-education"&gt;A deeper thought on context and education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never claim to be good at explaining what I mean when I say context. But I know what it means to me. And I hope what I am writing is inspiring some interest in the subject for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is not hard, dealing with your self it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take two people and put them through the same experience. Do they react the same way? No. Almost never, or nearly impossible. Why? Is Life itself actually that hard? No. Dealing with your self is the hard part of life. The judgemental, selfish, suffering internal narrative of your life is the hard part to cope with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are broken and destroyed after years in prison. Others come out and become radical social figures cough Mandela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context comes to play as we hope to change. Today, you know X number of things. When you look at the world you use X number of things to create your understanding of it. What you know helps dictate the things you pay attention to, like the stupid humans in your way or the puffy clouds in the sky, or the cracks in the sidewalk, or the sounds of the birds. With today's X number of stuff you know, you are kinda limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adding new stuff to your bucket of knowledge, you allow for more possibilities. It can be as simple as this: You want to change? Great, start by googling "How does change work". It doesn't have to be complicated, or even specific. The more you learn the more opportunity you have to change your context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I began researching shame. I was deeply ashamed. The more I learned about how it worked, the more I began questioning myself with my curiosity. Is what I am feeling now shame? Or something else? If I am feeling ashamed right now why? What good is it doing for me to feel ashamed? I quickly began realizing tons of holes in my understanding of the world, my context, that kept me trapped in a world of shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you are willing to add new information to your context, it is going to be super hard to change your context. I promise you that. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-09-09:/posts/2018-09-09-context-the-beginning.html</guid></item><item><title>Stopping obsessive thoughts, another hopeful rant</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-08-15-another-hopeful-rant.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;On the internet, someone asked about how to stop obsessive thoughts and I went on a rant. So I figured I would share the outcome here. Sure some of it is repeat, but always a new way of saying the same thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="find-a-focus"&gt;Find a focus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want you to try and find something you can deeply focus on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overactive mind is a symptom of an under utilized body&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hobby, a sport, an instrument, a book. If it involves physical activity great. If it involves a fine tuned skill great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're trapped in observing mode. It's hard to get out of. But we can train. We can change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had DPDR for most of my life. At least a decade. Focused attention was the only safe place to be. That wasn't the only thing that got me out of DPDR. I still had to address my traumas. What I am suggesting is a good step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="do-not-believe-everything-you-think"&gt;Do not believe everything you think.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not my body. I am not my thoughts. I am something more than this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DPDR, we already learn to feel disconnected from the world, and sometimes our thoughts. Or at least from certain thoughts. But it is easy, regardless of this to believe all that you are is your thoughts. That "I" is nothing more than the never ending stream of thoughts. Should you stop thinking, you would stop being. But this isn't really the case. There is more going on than your thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the attempt to not believe every thought you have. Trying to sit back and be an observer to your thoughts, is part of the concept behind meditation. It is sad really, how it appears like meditation and the search for enlightenment look similar to DPDR. But they are different. Now that I am real, I can still sit back and observe my thoughts, I can let the bad thoughts roll by. I can catch myself when I get caught up in a horrible pattern that's only bringing me down. But I am now also able to live inside the stream of consciousness and let myself exist with analyzing. I can simply be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore OKAY to have all kinds of thoughts. Weird thoughts, repetitive thoughts, anxious thoughts. The more you can separate yourself from the thoughts, the more you might be able to "feel" to yourself (or interrupt your thoughts with other thoughts) that you don't want to believe those thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="narrating-your-own-life"&gt;Narrating your own life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once observing your thoughts, and no longer feeling like all you are is your thoughts, it begins to be easier to make a choice about how you narrate your own life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This speech captures much of this section - &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhhC_N6Bm_s"&gt;This is water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have a story we believe of ourselves. A version of who we are we think we are. When you make a mistake do you tell yourself &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a piece of shit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I fucked up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I suck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or do you tell yourself &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gosh I tried hard, but next time I will do better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do we fall Bruce, so we can learn to get back up again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mistakes happen, should I apologize for something?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hard as it seems to change our thoughts, which story we tell ourselves helps inform how we feel, and then act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is not hard. Dealing with your self is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could take a hundred people and put them through the same challenge. No two person will respond the same way. Living, staying alive, breathing, is not the hard part of life. The hard part is coping with you, dealing with you and yourself. We are our biggest critic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can choose to change the story we believe about ourselves. I can go from thinking I am a piece of shit when I fail, to thinking failure only comes when you didn't try your best, for when you try your best it is not truly a failure and I will try again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult part of this is the beginning.  Which is where the next section comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-habits-fit-in"&gt;How habits fit in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how habits work, are formed, and dismantled really helped me overcome a bunch of my obsessive thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a great read or listen - &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/"&gt;The Power of Habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part of changing habits in my eyes, is being able to zoom out and look at yourself, and your life from the perspective of years. I spent over a decade in DPDR. Therefore I should expect it to take me years to recover fully. Is it practical for me to think I could come back in just 6 months?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deeper you can instill this notion, that recovery is slow and not a straight line, the more likely you are to be nice to yourself when you falter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my 6 years of recovery, I have slipped back into depression 5 times. I restarted smoking 3 times. I fucked up taking my medications 4 times. I felt close to giving up many times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I zoomed out, and looked at my whole story, I realized this was how it all worked. I would make progress, but stumble, I would go slowly, because of where I started, and I could envision a future where I overcame it all. I would try to imagine what a recovered version of myself would look like 5 years from now and aim for that. And I would feel better. I would feel okay that today, I slipped up. But so long as I keep trying, going back to trying. I would get there eventually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respect the process. Accept the process. Find any way you can to enjoy today because once you are "recovered" you'll never get to experience the joy of watching yourself recover again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope any of this is helpful my friend.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-08-15:/posts/2018-08-15-another-hopeful-rant.html</guid></item><item><title>The weight I feel</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-07-16-weight.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I am feeling just how heavy all the important things are in life. The responsibility I could take on should I choose to. And this is a good feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am at my happiest it seems I am eager to take on the responsibilities of life. I am happy to be part of the ever expanding network of souls all interconnected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people find most of life mundane, repetitive, boring. I see every moment of life sacred, huge, and exhilerating... When I am taking my medications properly. haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously this post is about taking your meds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have proven to myself five times now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I simply cannot be happy if I am not taking my medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a failing of mine. I am not bad for needing medications. IT just so happens the medication I need is related to a hormone disorder. So long as I take my medications I believe I can conquer every hurdle, every challenge, every fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep at it!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-07-16:/posts/2018-07-16-weight.html</guid></item><item><title>A year of realness: thoughts for long term sufferers of DPDR</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-06-23-another-year-retrospective.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;After 29 years of life I finally became real. In my one year of realness I have changed significantly, some ways desirable, many ways I'm still horrified of. I wanted to share some thoughts on how my long term depersonalization has impacted my entrance into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost I am still generally afraid to make changes of conviction in my life. My decades of unreality stripped me of my sense of self, desires, preferences. Today, when my mind tries to tell me what I'm attracted to or desire my first reaction is to retract and understand WHY I want that. Contrary to how I'm told I should behave, it feels deeply unsettling to me to make a choice unless I know it's my REAL choice. Sadly I learn over and over I can never know enough about me and the universe to fully comprehend the cause for my preferences. If your DPDR prevents you from self expression, I'd expect it to continue for some time after reality. The length I think will depend on how long you were unreal. I couldn't even buy a new pair of socks without freaking out when I was in DPDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another consequence of my longevity in limbo seems to be a general susceptibility to ideas. I felt this in my unreality that any idea could infect me so I became rather timid about what I took in. My new sense of realness made me feel empowered to explore but I have suffered the consequences. I still have yet to form a strong enough conviction and fortitude to withstand confronting unhealthy ideas for any extended period of time. Be wary about your path. Respect the power of ideas. Learn intently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more personal issue stems from empathy. Since I had no sense of self nearly all my thoughts were directed toward others. This habit of thinking gave me some great insights into human behavior but also gave me some blind spots. As I've become more self oriented in my thoughts I've found more anger, selfishness, frustration, and pettiness. It sucks. Is it more than what the average person experiences? Will these emotions settle into the landscape and not feel so prominent over time? Regardless I feel pretty bad a lot of the times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate feeling anger but I think it's my surest sign of self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still unsure if being real is better. I spent so long in nihilism and suicidal ideation that I still don't see a way for me to have a fruitful or positive life. But know that this is not necessarily because of my DPDR experience. I am transsexual with a genetic chronic pain condition which is exacerbated by my hormone treatment. While my brain obviously operate more effectively on estrogen my body does not. This conflict makes me feel undeserving, useless, and unattractive. People fall for my personality because I hide the truth of my pain so when they later learn the reality of how I suffer they just feel bad for me instead of running away. I don't know if I wish they ran away or not. Most of the time I wish they did. I am no longer suicidal but I desperately want life to kill me. Would I be able to weather this storm easier if I hadn't had DPDR? Certainly. Was my DPDR caused by my transsexuality and chronic pain as a defense mechanism? Likely. Do I fear my life may still end at my own hand? Yup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are suffering from DPDR or recently found reality please look at a calendar and remind yourself how long you were unreal as you grow. I spent 9,940 days unreal. I have been real for 395 days. I have been real for only 4.1% of my life. That's it. I'm gonna be messy for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will not be a fast recovery if you spent five, ten, twenty years in DPDR. The fact that you got out is remarkable. Never forget that. Here's to hoping this post makes me feel better.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-06-23:/posts/2018-06-23-another-year-retrospective.html</guid></item><item><title>I am one year real</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-05-28-one-year-real.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Saturday was the day. I had a party where I invited some people close to me to come out and play in a park by the ocean. It was easier than I expected to have them all in the same place. Unfortunately some of the people I really wish were there couldn't be because of distance. But I was happy with how many were close enough to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still feel real. I know I am real. I have the kindling to a sense of self. But the flame is still weak and I have a long way to go. I still despise and suck at self expression. What I want to express is always dictated by others and feels irrelevant to me. I still don't know who I am. And I am disgusted at the process. But I do it because I must. I am human after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this realness I have gained a lot of new skills. I can now say no better. I can test people and ideas. I can protect myself more. I can allow myself to experience life without overwhelming empathy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is honestly hard to reflect in a meaningful way lately/right now. I am so busy trying to help my mom, trying to keep moving forward. I know that's supposed to be a good thing. It is such a strange thing however, because I spent so much time reflecting, thinking abstractly and philosophically, that to merely exist feels like folly. OR something. It's just strange in a way I used to denigrate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="one-thing-is-clear"&gt;One thing is clear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have conquered the thought habits of shame. I am more hopeful than not. I am more flexible than not. I am more open to the idea of survival than not. And that is the most important thing. That is the foundation for all my future progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 May 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-05-28:/posts/2018-05-28-one-year-real.html</guid></item><item><title>A moment of clarity</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-04-09-some-clarity.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I awoke from something awkward and awful. Half past five in the morning is a lovely time to be filled with dread and unknowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I envisioned my behavior at my last job as toxic. I wanted to be a good monkey, but I failed. Then I found my way inside the last two years. I see myself from a rather disappointed place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start and stop my medications. I feel invigorated and productive only to crash into binge watching and internet lurking. I am sociable and friendly before cowering alone. I hold hope tightly then let it spill across the bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="i-try-and-try-again-to-find-firm-ground-but-sink-every-time"&gt;I try and try again to find firm ground, but sink every time.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I a bipolar sociopath?&lt;br&gt;
A depressed emotionally detached chronic pain addict?&lt;br&gt;
A ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come across intelligent and capable. I suppose those things are true, but I mean to imply I hide my chaos very well. I position myself as this caring, empathetic, selfless soul who must help others. Any hope at living selfishly is rejected in a heartbeat. I must remain trapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should hold tightly to the fact I have only been real for a year. That's it. This sensation of connection with my life is that young. As my friend said "the rest will come". I am filling in the spaces now. Finally. And I do have proof of that. So I suppose this moment is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="does-that-mean-i-am-getting-better-slowly"&gt;Does that mean I am getting better slowly?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt this moment will amount to any obvious change quickly. It may not even be defining. Maybe it is another step of many similar moments which I am building my recovery. Maybe by writing this down, and making sure I capture this moment in my mind by writing about it I will help ensure it gets added to the glue. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-04-09:/posts/2018-04-09-some-clarity.html</guid></item><item><title>What can I focus on to keep recovering?</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-03-01-things-to-do.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I know I address this in different ways periodcially, but here's another list which might inspire you to keep working your way towards recovery:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a quality therapist who's aim is to reduce suffering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research the topic of anxiety &amp;amp; recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and maintain a list of Life goals to direct your actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn/Practice Mindfulness/Meditation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise, Eat Healthy, Drink water, Sleep well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a few mantras to help instill your dreams/goals/beliefs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn about relationships/shame/vulnerability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin a new hobby that will help you meet new people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go outside on a daily basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read books instead of browse the internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List all of your anxieties in terms of what you fear, then write a list of actions/goals you could take to address the underlying fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-03-01:/posts/2018-03-01-things-to-do.html</guid></item><item><title>Coping with negative emotions</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-02-24-coping-with-dejection.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Quick tip here. We all experience thoughts about negative things. This can range from guilt to shame, to suicidality. Yikes. For someone like me, where I spent years allowing suicidal thoughts exist in my mind, it can be tough to not let them win. Here's my way of releasing those thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mantras"&gt;Mantras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not my body. I am not my thoughts. I am something more than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've seen me write this before. But this helps separate myself from the issue directly. Because...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not the problem. The problem is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great sentence one of my older therapists shared with me. I beleive it comes from &lt;code&gt;Narrative Therapy&lt;/code&gt;, which I love and you should check out if you're interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/kill-a-part.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="release"&gt;Release&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is to find a way to release these thoughts into the world. If kept inside, the boil, ferment, spoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to a rubber duck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes from the programming industry. The tale goes, that a programmer should first try to explain their problem to a rubber duck before seeking a real person. This is because, simply attempting to explain the problem outside your head will help you lead to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write it down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to a rubber duck, writing it down is a safe easy way to let it out. This comes with some fun variations. If you change the audience you imagine yourself writing for, you will process the problem differently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try writing your problem to:
    1. Your self
    2. Your best friend
    3. Your mother
    4. A support group
    5. The entire internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised how you change your wording to explain the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share with a real human&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find someone you trust and feel safe with. Make sure to ask yourself: "What kind of response am I hoping for?" Are you essentailly seeking validation, to vent, or are you looking for solutions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="do-not-let-your-negativity-win"&gt;Do not let your negativity win! ðŸ¤—&lt;/h2&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-02-24:/posts/2018-02-24-coping-with-dejection.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
