Half past five in the morning is a lovely time to be filled with dread and unknowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I envisioned my behavior at my last job as toxic. I wanted to be a good monkey, but I failed. Then I found my way inside the last two years. I see myself from a rather disappointed place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start and stop my meds. I feel invigorated and productive only to crash into binge watching and internet lurking. I am sociable and friendly before cowering alone. I hold hope tightly then let it spill across the bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="i-try-and-try-again-to-find-firm-ground-but-sink-every-time"&gt;I try and try again to find firm ground, but sink every time.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I a bipolar socipath?&lt;br&gt;
A depressed emotionally detached chronic pain addict?&lt;br&gt;
A ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come across intelligent and capable. I suppose those things are true, but I mean to imply I hide my chaos very well. I position myself as this caring, empathetic, selfless soul who must help others. Any hope at living selfishly is rejected in a heartbeat. I must remain trapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should hold tightly to the fact I have only been real for a year. That's it. This sensation of connection with my life is that young. As my friend said "the rest will come". I am filling in the spaces now. Finally. And I do have proof of that. So I suppose this moment is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="does-that-mean-i-am-getting-better-slowly"&gt;Does that mean I am getting better slowly?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt this moment will amount to any obvious change quickly. It may not even be defining. Maybe it is another step of many similar moments which I am building my recovery. Maybe by writing this down, and making sure I capture this moment in my mind by writing about it I will help ensure it gets added to the glue. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-04-09:/posts/2018-04-09-some-clarity.html</guid></item><item><title>What can I focus on to keep recovering?</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-03-01-things-to-do.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I know I address this in different ways periodcially, but here's another list which might inspire you to keep working your way towards recovery:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a quality therapist who's aim is to reduce suffering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research the topic of anxiety &amp;amp; recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and maintain a list of Life goals to direct your actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn/Practice Mindfulness/Meditation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise, Eat Healthy, Drink water, Sleep well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a few mantras to help instill your dreams/goals/beliefs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn about relationships/shame/vulnerability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin a new hobby that will help you meet new people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go outside on a daily basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read books instead of browse the internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List all of your anxieties in terms of what you fear, then write a list of actions/goals you could take to address the underlying fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-03-01:/posts/2018-03-01-things-to-do.html</guid></item><item><title>Coping with negative emotions</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-02-24-coping-with-dejection.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Quick tip here. We all experience thoughts about negative things. This can range from guilt to shame, to suicidality. Yikes. For someone like me, where I spent years allowing suicidal thoughts exist in my mind, it can be tough to not let them win. Here's my way of releasing those thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mantras"&gt;Mantras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not my body. I am not my thoughts. I am something more than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've seen me write this before. But this helps separate myself from the issue directly. Because...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not the problem. The problem is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great sentence one of my older therapists shared with me. I beleive it comes from &lt;code&gt;Narrative Therapy&lt;/code&gt;, which I love and you should check out if you're interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/kill-a-part.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="release"&gt;Release&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is to find a way to release these thoughts into the world. If kept inside, the boil, ferment, spoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to a rubber duck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes from the programming industry. The tale goes, that a programmer should first try to explain their problem to a rubber duck before seeking a real person. This is because, simply attempting to explain the problem outside your head will help you lead to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write it down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to a rubber duck, writing it down is a safe easy way to let it out. This comes with some fun variations. If you change the audience you imagine yourself writing for, you will process the problem differently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try writing your problem to:
    1. Your self
    2. Your best friend
    3. Your mother
    4. A support group
    5. The entire internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised how you change your wording to explain the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share with a real human&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find someone you trust and feel safe with. Make sure to ask yourself: "What kind of response am I hoping for?" Are you essentailly seeking validation, to vent, or are you looking for solutions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="do-not-let-your-negativity-win"&gt;Do not let your negativity win! ðŸ¤—&lt;/h2&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-02-24:/posts/2018-02-24-coping-with-dejection.html</guid></item><item><title>Where do I start?</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-02-16-the-plan.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;You're trapped. You feel you cannot get out of this hole you are so deep in. When you're down here, at the bottom, what does it take to get up? How do you begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="breathe"&gt;Breathe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at a high level of an approach to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desire - do you even want to recover?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore - seek out new information to help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage - actively pursue recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat - Cycle, rest, plateau, climb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know. You've heard it before. That's precisely the issue isn't it! Some of these concepts really help but sometimes we are in a resistive mood. We get stuck in a stubborn place and stand still begrudgingly. Change is hard. So read on anyway. Remind yourself of these things or learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this post focuses on DPDR, the issues are abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-are-you-now"&gt;Where are you now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body, your brain is built for dissociation. We know this because you experience it. Some people struggle with anger. Others, maybe like yourself, struggle with depression. What a wonderous thing to accept the way you are rather than despise it. Try as you might, but you will never experience the other side. THIS IS OK. What a world it would be if you could change on a dime, or there wasn't an infinite possibility of humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've been stuck in DPDR for so long your brain is super good at it. This is the fight. This is your struggle. You train your mind, body, and soul to resist a natural yet encouraged state of being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="desire-do-you-want-it"&gt;Desire - Do you want it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've got to want it. You've got to be willing to change who you think you are. You've got to push outside your comfort zone regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I am.&lt;br&gt;
I will never get out of this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe these thoughts, and you will, indeed, stay this way. Trapped by our history, it seems because I have been this for so long, I am unable to be any different. This is a fallacy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not my DPDR, I struggle with DPDR.&lt;br&gt;
If I can overcome this, I will be awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This peeks at the heart of identity. I am something versus I have something. Let the problem be the problem. You are not the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can find the drive and commitment to engage in your own recovery you've got the most important piece down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="explore-there-is-always-something-new-to-learn"&gt;Explore - there is always something new to learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing would be to learn a lot about habits, change, recovery, identity, shame, vulnerability. Be willing to explore any potential childhood trauma which may source this in you. Find your weak points and build your understanding. When you have the tools to repair a car it's a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly every chapter of my life I've felt like I have "tried everything." Laughable. In a universe which is unlimited, can one truly say they have tried EVERYTHING? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="engage-conquer-those-fears"&gt;Engage - conquer those fears&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then engage. With the previous thoughts in mind, ACT! I know you can do it. I know you can face your fears and be caring towards yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept the chapter you are in. You are at that critical point in the character's story where they finally say "ENOUGH!" and truly begin their quest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you begin yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="tips-for-engagnement"&gt;Tips for engagnement&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mindfulness is a super awesome help. Imagine you have three raisins. In silence, pick up one raisin. Look, touch, smell it. Put it in your mouth and chew. Don't count just chew. Don't swallow just chew. It will go down when it's ready. Follow the raisin into your stomach. Now. Pick up the next raisin and do the same thing. -- You can totally build the skill of present minded action outside of dpdr. You likely experience it in small ways already so we know you're capable of it. Now it's time you habitualize it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use a stim toy. Tungsten ring which I've had almost a decade I sometimes spin on tables and watch. Kinda like a totem from inception. I watch I zone out. When it's done I come back. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other thing is more Pavlovian. I bought a small bottle of smelly stuff. I spent a couple months imprinting positive, in the moment, connected feeling into the smell. Now, when I find myself fading I smell it to come back. It really helps. Like a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fucking go for it. I knwo you can do this. ðŸ’•&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-02-16:/posts/2018-02-16-the-plan.html</guid></item><item><title>I need to get away from the internet, what can I do?</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-02-02-what-to-do.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hate how you spend all your time in front of computer screens or on the internet wasting time? Here is a list of ideas you can peruse for inspiration. Some of these are quite unconventional. Read carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pluck all your body hair with tweezers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice moving one eye but not the other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look up anatomy drawings and try to twitch all your muscles independently (Netter's atlas baby)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice character voices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn how to throat sing (proper name?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clean every little nook and cranny&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take something apart and put it back together again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;download Zim wiki and start your own personal wiki of your life or simply write in a journal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go down memory lane and look at your old photos from 1992&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;philosophize about time, perception of time, habits around time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice and strengthen the muscles that wiggle your ears (start with extreme eye brow lifts to identify the muscles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read books! - use the library, find an e-reader with e-ink display, borrow from friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work on a puzzle if you have the flat surface area for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design tattoos for yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look through etsy for any futures hobbies you might want to get into&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;video chat with people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;re lace your shoes with a different pattern for funzies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice Taoist masturbation/sex stuff to connect with your body in new ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn to whistle in three different ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turn off all lights, get as dark as possible, and listen. Try to identify every sound you can hear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;block out as much sound and light as you can, and imagine scary stuff happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watch a visualizer while you listen to music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice an instrument if you have one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write letters to people, hell even to strangers. Just put the letter in some random mail box. Write nice things, inspirational things, love things. Not to scare people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watch documentaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explore things you don't understand, like maybe sexuality and gender (my faves)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watch free online college lectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you watch entertainment media, have paper ready to critique it while you watch instead of simply droning out in it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice breathing intentionally, like, breathe real slow for two minutes, or breathe slow then fast or something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn origami&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy a van, convert it to an RV, quit your job and become a nomad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite pass time. Conceptualize context. Understand context. Play with context. Dive your mind into the tiniest concept of molecules and focus on water, fluidity, or really explore the fabrics nearby. Zoom out to the universe level and conceptualize the galaxies, the vastness of space time, the orbital patterns if our solar system. Think of how the moon waxes and wanes, how it effects our planet, the way it illuminates the night. Think about how what you choose to think informs your understanding of reality, what your life feels like, and how you perceive others and their actions. Context is queen.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-02-02:/posts/2018-02-02-what-to-do.html</guid></item><item><title>Are you a failure?</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-02-01-stand-up.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Or do you simply believe the thought that you are a failure? If you HAVE failed in the past, can you not find ways to get better so you don't fail the same way again in the future? Failure is common but failure only comes knowing you didn't try your best. If you try your best it should not be considered failing. You put your all into that. Those failures should really be lessons learned. An opportunity to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you have been given the challenge of DPDR in your lifetime. Others get cancer, or abuse, or spinal injuries, or schizophrenia, or others. You have been given the chance to overcome this in your life. It is not easy. But everyone has their thing. And if you can stand up, brush yourself off, look around, put those fists up and keep fighting, I know you will find a way to conquer these demons. To find out why you think you hate yourself and banish those thoughts. To find all the reasons you love yourself, how you are good, and how you want to get better. To learn to deserve the love you receive and feel worthy of the good things you are lucky to experience. If this is something you want, you'll have to find it yourself. You'll have to fight, be patient, and learn a lot of new things. But this is your life. Your only life. Will you take your own hand?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-02-01:/posts/2018-02-01-stand-up.html</guid></item><item><title>Life is not hard, dealing with your self is</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-01-15-live-is-not-hard.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Seriously. Life itself is not hard. Every living creature figures out how to do it. Our body and minds are designed to keep living as long as we can. Some species have apparently survived for tens of thousands of years, and some over a million right? Life, living, not dying, is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/you-against-the-world.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with your &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; is hard. Why is it that two people can experience the same traumatic event but respond so differently? How can some bounce back while others stay crushed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/survived-every-day.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is to say, that life is not to blame. No outside force is going to save you, fix you. YOU ARE GOING TO FIX YOU. Because you can, and you will, because you fucking love yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/afraid-to-fail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is your life, this dark, scary, sad, horrifying, anxious, depressed, dissociated, mess of a life, why not do and try everything to find as much joy, happiness, playfulness, fun, love, light as possible? This is your only life! Make it what you will, not the result of giving in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/you-think-you-have-time.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All it takes is a spark, an unending flame that boils inside you to never give up, never give in, and never forget to keep pushing, to keep trying, and to explore the world and all of reality so you can find what feeds you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that spark ignites, you'll know. Once you find a way to keep that flame burning no matter how sad, depressed, anxious, or fucked up you feel, you'll know. Once you have that day, where you are down in the pits but remember, oh right, I've got this flame, this urge, this desire, this need to recovery, and take another step out, you'll know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was written in the midst of a partial hospitalization after a serious bout with suicidality. Never stop asking yourself questions. These questions helped bring me to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="life-is-not-hard-dealing-with-yourself-is"&gt;Life is not hard, dealing with yourself is.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billions of people have lived and died all with their own experience of life, reality. Is it that life is hard intrinsically or that your experience, your perspective, is what creates the challenges you face? Is it intrinsically difficult to alter the way you respond to the minutia of what life brings? Can we assess our attachment to certain behaviors, thoughts, reactions, and make choices regarding their relevancy? Have you ever watched someone succeed at something you fail at and wonder how they are so lucky? What causes us to respond to events the way we do? and how do you close the gap to respond desirably?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it that some others do not struggle the way I do? Are my problems permanent? Which are conquerable? Which can only be managed? Can you approach your problems from many angles to determine which type your problems truly are? And how is it that others simply move forward after traumas, hardship, and problems? What do they know that you don't? Is it as simple as saying I will choose this response? What even makes an even something you will struggle with? How long does it take for you to generally get beyond the struggle and moved forward? Can you find the tools to help minimize the amount of time you struggle so you can move forward? Is this related to change and how we cope with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between your self and other selves? Is it possible to see how another responds to certain stimuli and calculate the distance between your response and theirs? How often is the distance merely a  formation of habit? Are habits all that hard to change? How often is the distance a gap in knowledge or awareness of a concept? Is it really hard to open yourself to learning something new?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dissociation-and-its-role-in-my-life"&gt;Dissociation and its role in my life.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of my memories from childhood contain dissociation. I always felt shuffled along by the whims of my kith, doing and being what they wanted me to be. This sense of always watching and always thinking led me to the conclusions I have formed and the perspective I have acquired. I have wisdom because I have never truly lived my life. My sharing is never just for my expression. I live in the windows of others and calculate language to account for them, not me. I try not to dissociate. My transition is about trying to take hold of my association. I only ever feel associated alone. I don't feel like I can ever get rid of my dissociation. What I am, what I know, has crafted such a foundation that cannot be rebuilt. My dissociation is me. Without it I would be someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="positivity"&gt;Positivity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I have limited my dissociation some in the last three years. Before was a total haze. Proof I can make progress. But how much more do I need? I have eliminated my judgments of others. I have found my sympathy for myself. I can understand my language choices better to accurately reflect my understandings and be heard by others. I sometimes have gender euphoria! I have support from nearly all my kith. My kith appreciate what I have to offer despite my reservations of compliments. I can take compliments without them knocking me down or sounding ill-received.  I was able to participate on my first day at this program. However my engagement was nearly all removed from the actual group. I didn't shut down those that chose to talk to me. I did not panic.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-13:/posts/2018-01-13-asking-questions.html</guid></item><item><title>Days of saving are over</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-11-27-saving-is-over.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/days-of-saving.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this, but I also want to pick it apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am bedding with someone who inspires growth in me, how will I determine if this person is trying to save me? IS it okay to bed with someone who IS trying to save me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implication I believe, is that this person once was a savior/white knight. Now they realize how detrimental it was to their life, so they will no longer. Only bringing "healthy" people into their life. That is well and good. I'm curious though, does this preclude you from circling back to helping again? Or is it simply important to distinguish between the difference of saving and helping?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I, personally, Luna, find a way to connect with people who need a step up without doing more harm than good given what I am?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do hope I find more people who inspire me.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-11-27:/posts/2017-11-27-saving-is-over.html</guid></item><item><title>I am 6 months real now</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-11-26-six-months-real.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Fuck I hate being real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months now I have pushed, shoved, cried, tried, fallen, and gotten back up. I have changed a lot, discovering more of who I can be and stepping outside my boundaries. Let me tell you. I hate it. I would much rather be pain free than real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="heres-what-ive-found"&gt;Here's what I've found&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain. Painpainpainpainpain. Everything leads back there. I do too much, pain. I get anxious, pain. I get stressed, pain. It's all a sick loop. The more pain I am in, the more anxious and stressed I am. All of my mental health problems are triggered by pain. When my pain is minimal I am generally okay. And such a rare instance when that happens. The meds I am taking make pain killer ineffective. WTF was I thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being real makes me think I am worthy of a life. A regular life. A life where I keep good people with me, find others who inspire love, and maybe eventually settle into a place. But fuck like that will ever happen. I can understand someone who loved me sticking around if I developed this pain problem, but no one in their right mind would willingly enter into a live long love relationship with me now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I shall accept my role. I shall give my whole self to my trans siblings. For anything to lift them up. And yet, there may come a time, when I've completeld my bucket list, I may decide I've done enough. And why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="forward-on"&gt;Forward on&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I've been having some bad days with all this driving. And one of my meds ran out, but my new insurance doesn't start for a few days so I'm kinda stuck. It's the one pill I take that actually makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I will keep trying to remedies. I will keep fighting and changing. I will keep going. Like I have. And so long as I can cast the bad thoughts out I'll be fine right? RIGHT? Meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope being real gets better&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 26 Nov 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-11-26:/posts/2017-11-26-six-months-real.html</guid></item><item><title>Reading "The Fault in our Stars"</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-11-21-fault-in-our-stars.html</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fault is not in our stars, but in ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much of what I'm learning is that it's okay for me to love, to be loved, and to feel worthy of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once believed so strongly I did not deserve to be me. Because I have always planned to end my life you'd be better off not knowing me. I'm only to die, the only thing I am allowed is to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those feelings have not changed much, except my attachment to them. I am eager for, searching for a way to lose them. I can give, I can benefit, I can be me without causing pain and without ending my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't expect me to stop wishing for death however. This part of me is cemented in the foundation of my experience and I will inevitably talk about my death as a coping mechanism, strategy, and analogy for making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it magically universal, poignant, I should choose to read this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many other facets of my life, I had little idea what this book was about, merely "a love story". With no clue of it's relevance to my health, I am thankful for the revelations of my ignorance, grateful for the inspiration the simple act of acknowledging the coincidence brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about changing my name again. For about two weeks I have entertained the idea, but so far have found comfort and unity in Luna Inanis Umbra.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-11-21:/posts/2017-11-21-fault-in-our-stars.html</guid></item><item><title>The definition of hope</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-11-17-definition-of-hope.html</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was not great, but tomorrow might be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/hope.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could remember who suggested this be the definition of hope. Likely Brene Brown. However this image has been adorable  and helpful for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you get to that point of believing tomorrow might be better, will probably take a lot of effort. And time. If you don't think this already, it might be real tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do believe that we all have the power within us to make tomorrow better. To fight against the crap and push towards a better life. Be hopeful. Create hope. Hope is a skill. Build that skill. Don't let pessimism, nihilism, or depression keep you from sleep walking through your life!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-11-17:/posts/2017-11-17-definition-of-hope.html</guid></item><item><title>I have come farther than I give myself credit</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-11-05-i-have-come-far.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Amidst writing a post on reddit seeking help for reducing shame, I realized I would not get anything new from it. I have everything I need to keep revealing myself. I need to push myself and act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I learned deeply from my strict violin teacher growing up, you will never be perfect. But unlike her, I do not believe we have to aim for perfect. Her effect, and the effect of most others in my life taught me I should aim for perfect. What I found is that always aiming for perfect will shroud you from the progress you've made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-have"&gt;I have:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stopped working in an industry that suffocated me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Came out, and began HRT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushed myself to squelch most of my anxiety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fought through my dysphoria enough to blend in most of the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created a female voice which people compliment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought a van, converted it enough to live in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reignited my affair with the violin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Found a very real sense of living as a women, despite still fearing my femininity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began this journey from a deeply dark place. I have lifted myself out quite far considering. I must find ways to never forget this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will never quit. I will allow myself to be fully human and experience life. I will fight until life kills me.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-11-05:/posts/2017-11-05-i-have-come-far.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
