For many reasons I now live in a van and stay where it is warm. This should be the first year I am able to spend the entire winter in the south, ideally never touching cold weather at all. I am very excited to get back on the road. I have many people across the east coast whom I care about, there are so many places I would like to see, and I find the pressures to stay away from digital life a peaceful feeling. I did not expect to spend so much time in MA this year but I am glad I did, and in some ways, I am sad to be leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned so much from the people I have connected with. I have felt new feelings and learned how to process them. I was pushed to step in ways I wasn't prepared for. And I am so greatful to all those who have stood with me and watched the days role by. I will miss you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-love-the-trans-community-in-ways-we-find-it-too-cliche-to-allow-cis-people-to-claim"&gt;I love the trans community, in ways we find it too cliche to allow cis people to claim.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love it for the foritude, courage, and conviction it takes to make your own terms for life. I say fuck your world, I am going to live in mine. You don't have to live in the cis-het consumerist shameful disconnected digital world that's shoved at us. While I may hope everyone finds their own way into their own world, I have little patience for the cis people who are so resistant. So I focus on my siblings who are hurting so badly from a dissonance that can sometimes take decades to understand. To help them let go of the world our pupetteers have been smothering us with and accept a new world in spite of the shame you think it bears. The shame is not in being trans. The shame is being so afraid of change and freedom you would push others to conform. Fuck shame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I spent so much time at my local support group. I feel lucky. I found my path to overcoming the majority of my traumas and anxieties. I am not done, but I have done the bulk of the work. I also spent most of my life helping others heal and take great pleasure in watching others transform into happier healthier people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is hard. Remaking your own world. Letting go of previous hopes. Finding any hope amongst a pit of despair. Falling down and getting back up over and over again. It sucks. And I promise you it will always kind of suck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-silly-advice"&gt;The silly advice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became a lot easier for me to transition when I began zooming out on my life and looking at it from a distance. To take a grander shape of my own life and step back from the minutiae of my weekly life. I forced myself to look at my life in terms of the seasons, the moon cycles, the number of weddings I might go to. I began looking at my life in terms of chapters in a book. Which chapter am I reading/writing right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I tried to plan the next chapter? What if I envision a future version of me who's a little bit farther ahead then me and ask "How did that person get from where I am today to where they are next year?" Work back from the future to find the steps and write it down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;

                &lt;/iframe&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what good is all that if you can't find any single moment of joy today? While I seem broken now that's not going to stop me from relishing the fact that I'm going to take steps forward. To prevent me from finding joy in as many moments as possible. To laugh at myself when I goof up. I only get to go through this once. And when I look back on it I hope I found a way to smile sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-09-12:/posts/2018-09-12-bye-support-group.html</guid></item><item><title>Context is Queen</title><link>http://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-09-09-context-the-beginning.html</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context is everything. Context is the distance between everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now you have a certain way of framing the world, a certain perception of how everything works, a certain window if you will, on the world. This is your context. Everyone has their own context. Their own window on the world. The combination of biology, birthplace, age, experiences, education, relationships, all help determine the context of each person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change your context and you change your world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways of changing your context. This concept is so damn broad. Some things about your context you cannot change. Where you were born, your past, your age. Some things are harder to change, biology. Some things are easier to change, current relationships, education, active experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-greatest-tools-you-have-to-trying-to-change-your-context-are-imagination-and-curiosity"&gt;The greatest tools you have to trying to change your context are: Imagination and Curiosity.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity is marked by asking questions. Ask new questions, old questions, and silly questions. Asking questions helps you investigate new possible answers. Your brain goes off on an expedition hoping to create an answer to your question. The more you explore new answers the more you open yourself up to existing in a new context. Seeking others answers does not work as well. It is the internal process of creating your own answers that has a greater impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagination is the tool you use to create a vision for yourself. The vision of how you might recover, what it might look like, who you want to be when you recover. Imagine the future you, happy, content, REAL, and look back in time to the process you took. Imagine what future you had to do in order to get real. Take the steps backward and build a path from today to that future you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="start-building-a-new-context-using-themes-of-acceptance-as-its-foundation"&gt;Start building a new context using themes of acceptance as its foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have improper expectations about how recovery works. This leads to impatience, disappointment, and lots of dejection. However, if you start by learning about, exploring ideas, about what recovery is really like, you can help yourself right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn about how recovery is not a straight line, but a squiggly mess. Learn how to be okay with the fact that today this is where you are, and it is okay because you are committed to taking tiny steps forward. Every week you come up with a tiny step to take and see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find symbols and imagery to remind you how long and weird recovery is. You tape them to your walls, and beat into your head these new thoughts. When you stumble you don't think One step forward two steps back, you think, Yeah, it's hard to fight old habits and today I didn't win this round. That's okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep exploring how other people understand recovery. Try to really see the issue from their context. If you find a major plateau, progress stops for too long, too far a slip back, its okay. Take a step out and try to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-deeper-thought-on-context-and-education"&gt;A deeper thought on context and education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never claim to be good at explaining what I mean when I say context. But I know what it means to me. And I hope what I am writing is inspiring some interest in the subject for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is not hard, dealing with your self it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take two people and put them through the same experience. Do they react the same way? No. Almost never, or nearly impossible. Why? Is Life itself actually that hard? No. Dealing with your self is the hard part of life. The judgemental, selfish, suffering internal narrative of your life is the hard part to cope with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are broken and destroyed after years in prison. Others come out and become radical social figures cough Mandela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context comes to play as we hope to change. Today, you know X number of things. When you look at the world you use X number of things to create your understanding of it. What you know helps dictate the things you pay attention to, like the stupid humans in your way or the puffy clouds in the sky, or the cracks in the sidewalk, or the sounds of the birds. With today's X number of stuff you know, you are kinda limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adding new stuff to your bucket of knowledge, you allow for more possibilities. It can be as simple as this: You want to change? Great, start by googling "How does change work". It doesn't have to be complicated, or even specific. The more you learn the more opportunity you have to change your context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I began researching shame. I was deeply ashamed. The more I learned about how it worked, the more I began questioning myself with my curiosity. Is what I am feeling now shame? Or something else? If I am feeling ashamed right now why? What good is it doing for me to feel ashamed? I quickly began realizing tons of holes in my understanding of the world, my context, that kept me trapped in a world of shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you are willing to add new information to your context, it is going to be super hard to change your context. I promise you that. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-09-09:/posts/2018-09-09-context-the-beginning.html</guid></item><item><title>I sold my old car!</title><link>http://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-09-09-sold-mazda.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, I sold the car I should have sold 2 years ago after getting Vanessa. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made out okay, not as good as I would have if I sold it right away though. Sadly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did market research. I looked at Kelly Blue Book, got the car looked at for problems, and looked at the current market for my kind of car in my kind of range. This gave me an idea of what might sell the car fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used craigslist. I first listed it higher than I thought would sell. Every week I lowered the price if I did not get a buyer. I also adjusted the language after the 2nd lowering. I added MUST GO to the title of the post. The title had loads of details, the body had plenty of information and was totally honest, and I have very nice pictures of a very clean car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I hit the sweet spot number for a listing price I got many interested buyers. In three days I have five people look at it. I received my first offer after 4 days. I worked it out with that buyer and it was gone on the 7th day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt good about being able to haggle about the number, but given my impending desperation and my fears, I accepted a number $200 lower than I had hoped. We did do a back and forth on number. I think in the end I got a very good number considering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not disappointed at all in how any of it went down. My shame was at bay. When I goofed I fixed it. When I realized I had to prep the car better I did it. If I wasn't so desparate I might have done more, haggled more, or waited for a better offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a rearview mirror air freshner in that car sicne as long as I owned it. A painted bottled with a wooden top and string to hold it in place. It was never a good air freshner. After taking it down I realized, the reason it sucked was because I never actually opened it! I was supposed to twist off the wooden top and remove a plastic plug. HAHA. Turns out to be a very refreshing smell and I am excited to add it to Vanessa. Should help with the exhaust smells. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-09-09:/posts/2018-09-09-sold-mazda.html</guid></item><item><title>The end of summer recap</title><link>http://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-09-07-end-of-summer.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have been in Massachusetts for a very long time. In this post I think I'll recap as much as I can before I get tired of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally came back in January to deal with some medical stuff. That switfly turned into a total overall of my year, deciding I would stay to help my mother sell the family home. This shift inspired me to commit more energy to my local support group. I spent the spring focusing on the group, and trying to stay happy. Once warmer weather began pouring in I committed energy to the house. A few months of effort and the hosue was sold. Now three weeks after the house is sold, I have prepped a bunch for my departure. Only a few final thigns to button up. I should be out of here before September 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="support-group-efforts"&gt;Support Group Efforts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I became more involved in a local support group than I expected. I took on some responsibility which included holding a key to the building we use. When I left in Vanessa I did not properly pass on the responsiblity to someone else. I also started a website and new process for accepting new members. In my absense, the website went down for a time, and no one responded to incoming members for a period of almost 9 months. I was determined to setup a process to ensure this never happened again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found someone new to take on the legal responsibility and key bearing. With this new person we began devising a system to support the most important functions of the group. We decided to use Values-Based Consensus. This system seems alright and theoretically removes power from individuals greatly. We began implementing this system and bi-monthly consensus meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so shocked by everything that has happened. There has been conflict. There has been progress. There has been people coming in and out, producing different levels of effort and interest. What has impacted me the most, is the amount of vulnerability it takes to be a leader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to be less visible than the other primary person because I always knew my tenure would be brief. I had thought if I was less visible the group would lose less momentum and motivation when I depart. I hope this is the case. Because of this, the extent of my involvment has not been clear to everyone which also created some issues. I knew taking this one would push me with regards to my leadership skills, interpersonal skills, openness, and vulnerability. I was certainly tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What brings me some pride has been my ability to bring people together. In the few conflicts which occured, I feel I was able to help find resolution without contempt. Everyone involved has always had an interest to do good, but our own struggles and fears get in the way sometimes. I hope I never forget the impact these events have had on me, and I continue to expand on what I learned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="selling-the-house"&gt;Selling the house&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told my mom as my energy began to come back that someone needs to take ownership of selling the house. It has to be their responsibility. Well, I finally got inspired once my hormones began to settle on a proper level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I planned and executed a yard sale. We made about $1000. It was a ton of work, but got rid of a bunch of stuff. After that I scheduled a dumpster to arrive. We got rid of a lot of hazardous waste, donated a ton of stuff and cleared out the basement all within two weeks time because of my planning. Phew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what effort that was! The day after we emptied the basement someone came in with an offer. From there it was a race to the finish. We had just over a month to finish everything. Two more dumptsers were ordered, weeks of effort cleaning, organizing, and moving took place. The very last day there was a last burst of effort to clean the insides and we made it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process taught me a lot about discipline. My owernship in the process came barely a week after my first year of being real. And in that realness there was more engagement in life than I have ever had before. I was motivated to get things done because others depended on me, because if we didn't finish I could never leave, and if I never left I would never see the people and experiences I was looking for. I had to engage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this I pushed my body more than I had in a very long time. I spent many days in a ton of pain, almost crying while working because the pain was so bad. But I had to continue. There was great satisfaction when we hit milestones. And disappointments when I had to stop because of my body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also keen on this because if we no longer have a family home, I no longer have a "home base" I can always return to. I have used this house the last two years as a rest from vanlife. And to cope with winters when I ran out of money or something. Now this is gone. While I have plenty of people willing to support me in many ways, this conceptual change feels very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="getting-ready-to-leave"&gt;Getting ready to leave&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am about two or three weeks from leaving. I have had a lot to do. Still a lot to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a phew really big tasks ahead. Sell my old Mazda, decide what to do with Vanessa, deal with all my stuff, and finish up work at the support group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today I accepted an offer on my car and I have two parties interested in the fridge. I can't wait until they are gone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa was a tougher choice. I had thought it was time to get a different van. But then the reapirs I had to do were safety related. Once I did them Vanessa felt like a whole new van. So I have decided to keep her until at least March. Depending on how well she does during the winter will decide whether I keep her or not. But before I can leave I am also replacing the windshield, getting the rust repaired and hopefully adjusting the door so the contacts work again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the support group. Things seem stable enough. I have planned my outro with a gathering. More people are coming than I expected. Honestly my engagement in the group and how others seem to view me is still hard to handle. I intellectually undertsand why I am appreciated at the group and by other trans people. That does not overpower my own internal bullshit however. It is easy for me to focus on my failings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="on-being-real"&gt;On being real&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being real is huge. Everything is so different. Everything keeps getting different. I continue to get more playful. I enjoy sharing myself with others, being myself, as odd as that sounds. I feel very little shame now. Shocking really. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have reinvigorated my interest in my music visualizer again. I got winamp installed on my laptop with Wine, and currently watching it while I type. There is something deeply satisfying about having it in my life again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also feel a much deeper peace with my femininity. Or at least, the amount of femininity I need to express at the moment. I am eager to find a wardrobe I am happier wearing, and I see that getting filled with more fun and playful clothing than I have now. I am not surprised I was wrapped with so much shame growing up because, if there is such a thing, my natural femininity is on the far side of things it seems. But again, it may just be for a time I need to spill it all over the world before I settle somewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am eager to finish getting ready. Get back on the vanlife road. To stop beating up my body on a regular basis. To find out more about who I am. And eager as all fuck for my tits to grow back ðŸ˜–&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Sep 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-09-07:/posts/2018-09-07-end-of-summer.html</guid></item><item><title>Kitchen building, day 1</title><link>http://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-08-25-kitchen-day-1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am finally building a kitchen unit in my van!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to do a fun thing and put the stove in a drawer. This way I don't ruin my countertop and space with a dumb looking thing. I am using an old large stainless steel mixing bowl for my sink. Because my mom is donating her old RV fridge to me, the unit is going to look odd, but that's okay. Free stuff and really cheap materials = good to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some pictures from the first day, and the sketchup design we slapped together. The trick part is going to be securing the unit to the inside. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 Aug 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-08-25:/posts/2018-08-25-kitchen-day-1.html</guid></item><item><title>I am free!</title><link>http://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-08-22-freedom.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The house sale is over.

So I figured I would share the outcome here. Sure some of it is repeat, but always a new way of saying the same thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="find-a-focus"&gt;Find a focus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want you to try and find something you can deeply focus on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overactive mind is a symptom of an under utilized body&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hobby, a sport, an instrument, a book. If it involves physical activity great. If it involves a fine tuned skill great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're trapped in observing mode. It's hard to get out of. But we can train. We can change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had DPDR for most of my life. At least a decade. Focused attention was the only safe place to be. That wasn't the only thing that got me out of DPDR. I still had to address my traumas. What I am suggesting is a good step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="do-not-believe-everything-you-think"&gt;Do not believe everything you think.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not my body. I am not my thoughts. I am something more than this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DPDR, we already learn to feel disconnected from the world, and sometimes our thoughts. Or at least from certain thoughts. But it is easy, regardless of this to believe all that you are is your thoughts. That "I" is nothing more than the never ending stream of thoughts. Should you stop thinking, you would stop being. But this isn't really the case. There is more going on than your thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the attempt to not believe every thought you have. Trying to sit back and be an observer to your thoughts, is part of the concept behind meditation. It is sad really, how it appears like meditation and the search for enlightenment look similar to DPDR. But they are different. Now that I am real, I can still sit back and observe my thoughts, I can let the bad thoughts roll by. I can catch myself when I get caught up in a horrible pattern that's only bringing me down. But I am now also able to live inside the stream of consciousness and let myself exist with analyzing. I can simply be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore OKAY to have all kinds of thoughts. Weird thoughts, repetitive thoughts, anxious thoughts. The more you can separate yourself from the thoughts, the more you might be able to "feel" to yourself (or interrupt your thoughts with other thoughts) that you don't want to believe those thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="narrating-your-own-life"&gt;Narrating your own life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once observing your thoughts, and no longer feeling like all you are is your thoughts, it begins to be easier to make a choice about how you narrate your own life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This speech captures much of this section - &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhhC_N6Bm_s"&gt;This is water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have a story we believe of ourselves. A version of who we are we think we are. When you make a mistake do you tell yourself &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a piece of shit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I fucked up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I suck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or do you tell yourself &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gosh I tried hard, but next time I will do better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do we fall Bruce, so we can learn to get back up again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mistakes happen, should I apologize for something?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hard as it seems to change our thoughts, which story we tell ourselves helps inform how we feel, and then act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is not hard. Dealing with your self is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could take a hundred people and put them through the same challenge. No two person will respond the same way. Living, staying alive, breathing, is not the hard part of life. The hard part is coping with you, dealing with you and yourself. We are our biggest critic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can choose to change the story we believe about ourselves. I can go from thinking I am a piece of shit when I fail, to thinking failure only comes when you didn't try your best, for when you try your best it is not truly a failure and I will try again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult part of this is the beginning.  Which is where the next section comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-habits-fit-in"&gt;How habits fit in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how habits work, are formed, and dismantled really helped me overcome a bunch of my obsessive thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a great read or listen - &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/"&gt;The Power of Habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part of changing habits in my eyes, is being able to zoom out and look at yourself, and your life from the perspective of years. I spent over a decade in DPDR. Therefore I should expect it to take me years to recover fully. Is it practical for me to think I could come back in just 6 months?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deeper you can instill this notion, that recovery is slow and not a straight line, the more likely you are to be nice to yourself when you falter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my 6 years of recovery, I have slipped back into depression 5 times. I restarted smoking 3 times. I fucked up taking my medications 4 times. I felt close to giving up many times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I zoomed out, and looked at my whole story, I realized this was how it all worked. I would make progress, but stumble, I would go slowly, because of where I started, and I could envision a future where I overcame it all. I would try to imagine what a recovered version of myself would look like 5 years from now and aim for that. And I would feel better. I would feel okay that today, I slipped up. But so long as I keep trying, going back to trying. I would get there eventually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respect the process. Accept the process. Find any way you can to enjoy today because once you are "recovered" you'll never get to experience the joy of watching yourself recover again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope any of this is helpful my friend.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-08-15:/posts/2018-08-15-another-hopeful-rant.html</guid></item><item><title>The weight I feel</title><link>http://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-07-16-weight.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I am feeling just how heavy all the important things are in life. The responsibility I could take on should I choose to. And this is a good feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am at my happiest it seems I am eager to take on the responsibilities of life. I am happy to be part of the ever expanding network of souls all interconnected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people find most of life mundane, repetitive, boring. I see every moment of life sacred, huge, and exhilerating... When I am taking my medications properly. haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously this post is about taking your meds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have proven to myself five times now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I simply cannot be happy if I am not taking my medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a failing of mine. I am not bad for needing medications. IT just so happens the medication I need is related to a hormone disorder. So long as I take my medications I believe I can conquer every hurdle, every challenge, every fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep at it!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-07-16:/posts/2018-07-16-weight.html</guid></item><item><title>We have a buyer for the house!</title><link>http://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-07-15-buyer.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;On Saturday last week someone put in an offer. After a quick we settled on a price. A week later we agreed on a terms sheet!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-house-is-sold"&gt;The house is sold!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are confident the new owners will have no issues with the banks, and we will do our part to vacate properly. The chances of the deal falling through are very minimal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="its-over"&gt;It's over.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packing, prepping, and emptying my childhood home is the reason for my snail pace in posting. So much energy focused on it. Combine that with my depression from winter and hormone imbalance and I didn't feel very good about life for a while. But with the summer, hormones, and success with the house I can't wait to finish up the summer. So much to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope I can reflect over the first half of this year and build some solid reminders or mantras to help me stay more stable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jul 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-07-15:/posts/2018-07-15-buyer.html</guid></item><item><title>So I never forget</title><link>http://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-07-13-to-never-forget.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Four times now in the last four years I have gone on this horrible cycle of staying on hormones for 8 months or so, then falling off the trail. This means four times I have learned this lesson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I start hating expression, my hormones are off balance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time it was all too apparent. I saw how my body not acting female, and too low of a dose caused me to feel dissociated, hating the world and expression. It manifests as frustration at how the world is, and incessantly asking the question "why". Why am I this way, why do I like this, why can't I have a choice in the matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news, is that since I conquered injections, I have never missed a dose. What I learned during my last blood work is that my current dosage of estrogen alone is putting my levels in a good range. I don't have to take an anti-androgen. Now, if my body still doesn't do the right thing after some more time I may start Lupron, or try Progesterone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means if I can stick to sticking a needle in my leg once a week I should never have to learn this lesson again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope I never go through this again. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-07-13:/posts/2018-07-13-to-never-forget.html</guid></item><item><title>Amanda Palmer - In My Mind</title><link>http://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-07-10-in-my-mind-palmer.html</link><description>&lt;/p&gt;

closed eyes and everything touches you
the humid air engulfs your skin
the smell of swamp burns
it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be this way.

Another step away from them
twigs snap, bones ache
and all I ever wanted was me
not because of them
fucking in spite of them
but that&amp;#39;s never felt right either

I guess I never stopped walking
cause that sun is up and I&amp;#39;m sweating
colors everywhere trying to say
hello there, fancy a bit of joy?
hesitant, peer pressure, who cares, why not
It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be this way.

Walking still I seem to have lost the night
the comfortable, friendly, painful night
it&amp;#39;s what i wanted, right?
I got what I wanted, right?
I got me, but what good is that?
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-07-10:/posts/2018-07-10-sorrow.html</guid></item><item><title>Help people, not ideas</title><link>http://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-07-07-helping-people.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am offering some time and money to someone in my life who is heavily involved in a church. As I considered if they had enough help I played a quick story in my head where I volunteered my time on a regular basis. Yes, I am not religious and have no interest in becoming so. But I still would want to help this person out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then concluded that I like to help people and not ideas. This is a nifty little nugget I think I should hold on to. It does a good job describing me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another conversation I had described a philosopher as someone who presents ideas but does not hold to them. Someone who may put together new ideas but not be attached to them. My friend rejected this notion. I don't care who is right, only that I think I was describing me and my situation. I enjoy knowing many perspectives on the same issue so I can help people, not promote a specific idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say I don't have my own feelings on issues, but that my general approach is to engage with people on their terms not against my own beliefs or ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I can be friends with the person who voted for trump, the anarchist, the socialist democrat, the non politically correct. It is why I have always seen my value in this life as a stepping stone for others. But don't follow me. I am not trying to make a value judgement on my way of life. I wouldn't recommend other people live like me or think like me. I am not very good at taking care of myself. I put everyone else before me. I struggle to understand who I am, what I want, what I like, and where I want to go. I expect and practically seek solitude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think this phrase, I help people, not ideas, is a solid phrase to help others understand why I am the way I am. And apparently I am writing about it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jul 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-07-07:/posts/2018-07-07-helping-people.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
