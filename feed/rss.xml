The spironolactone had fucked with me enough that I put my foot down to try something else. While, this chemical is not very effective, it is a stepping stone to trying Lupron. So I will try to track my progress with taking Finasteride to see if I notice a difference. But hopefully I well get on Lupron soon. That is much more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope I get my tits back üò°&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 12 May 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-05-12:/posts/2018-05-12-finasteride.html</guid></item><item><title>Vanessa got in a minor accident</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-05-11-accident.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;My mother was driving, we were shortly off the highway and a merging truck did not yield to us. My mother had no option to change lanes and the clipped my slider door and scraped toward the back. Very minor, but damn am I pissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not been in an accident since I was sixteen. I have no clue what's happening or whether they can even repair Vanessa back to original without simply replacing parts. And of course that's what I'd prefer because fuck them for their claimed blatant arrogance in assuming we were going to move over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to deal with another thing on my plate that is full of uncertainty and I'm sure, more hassle than I imagine... I'll post pictures after it's all over. Sigh. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 May 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-05-11:/posts/2018-05-11-accident.html</guid></item><item><title>I went to my first concert in a long time to see "This Will Destroy You"</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-05-11-this-will-destroy-you.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I was super jazzed. They were doing a tenth anniversary tour of their self title album. My favorite album of theirs alongside their first, Young Mountain. If they were playing their new stuff I would not have gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I went because this album has played an important roll in my life. I started listening to it in Burlington Vermont during my one year at school. I was so deeply depressed and ashamed, I used to walk around listening to their music and some others all around the Winooski River. I would get high off my ass and sink into the music until nothing existed except my horrible thought habits swirling around the atmosphere of the music. I love those times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I felt rather disconnected from any emotional experience during the show. I was happy. I was enjoying watching strangers nod and sway instead of moshing and dancing. I was present, but I felt rather flat. This feeling caught me off guard. I began thinking that being "real" is worse, because I am not experiencing the same level of emotional realness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking with some friends (yes I back date), I have begun to hope that this is simply a consequences of my recent realness. That I still need more time to come into and fill this life. I should have more patience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless. I was super super happy to get to go. I learned a lot. I enjoyed being slammed by these melodies I fell in love with almost a decade ago, and I drank a lot of water üòµ&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 May 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-05-11:/posts/2018-05-11-this-will-destroy-you.html</guid></item><item><title>Gallery Page updated</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-05-08-gallery-update.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I finally updated the gallery page to be more friendly-ish...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it only loads 800kb to start, instead of 20mb+ yay&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-05-08:/posts/2018-05-08-gallery-update.html</guid></item><item><title>Sometimes I think my chronic pain is a lie, today I felt better about it</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-04-25-different-pains.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago I spent a couple hours picking up trash at my favorite outlook. I tried my very best to bend properly, go slow, and take care of my body. It was exhausting and I needed a nap after. Turns out, I also worked out a lot of muscles grown weak during the winter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I felt the burn. I felt all the glute, quad, hamstring muscles sore. It was a lot of muscles at once and impacted my walking pace and stair climbing noticeably. This is normal and expected. Muscles get sore when you work them out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I went for a short walk and sat on the ground with a friend. In an effort to be impressive and flirt, I sat in position which were painful to me. I had taken a painkiller in preparation for this experience kinda knowing it would be ruff so in the moment, I felt okay enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours later and most of today I felt the consequences. I had a very real example of the difference between sore muscle pain, joint pain, and chronic pain. I am very happy to have had this moment. It makes me feel more validated in my experience of pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like muscle soreness. It is a good feeling. Joint pain and chronic pain is not a good feeling. As I have said for years now "a body in motion hurts less". And today is seems more relevant than ever. Thanks body.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 25 Apr 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-04-25:/posts/2018-04-25-different-pains.html</guid></item><item><title>Dejection in my transition</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-04-23-empty.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I don't think I have written about this nearly as much as I should. Because I have gone off and on my hormone meds many times now I feel I have fucked up my transition to a point and it is very disheartening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so let's be clear, it's really just one thing that's deeply upsetting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="i-have-lost-my-boobs"&gt;I have lost my boobs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the sense that four times my boobs have grown to an acceptable size, tiny sure, but notable. Four times they have shrunk back down to almost nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This breaks my heart in ways most don't seem to understand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stop my hormone treatment when I can't stand the pain any longer. This has always happened in the winter, when my tense cold body is tearing at my joints and it's too much. So I stop taking my spiro in an effort to reduce my side effects and try to hurt less. Every time I do this, I lose my breasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple my pain with my inability to eat normally, my depressive episodes, and it seems inevitable I'd lose them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My greatest fear is that I've "spent" all my breast growth and I will never get boobs again. Thinking about this makes me tear up every time. What if I MUST get implants in order to have boobs, which I've had before and lost several times? I don't want that reality. I really don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="so-what-can-i-do-about-it"&gt;So what can I do about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to focus again on how I can fix this problem. I've been wallowing a lot lately. Mostly because it is still cold in MA so I'm not mentally prepared to go back on my Spiro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to doctor about other chemical to suppress testosterone other than Spiro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've heard of trans women using:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finasteride&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyproterone Acetate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flutamide/Bicalutamide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lupron&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back in the day they used to "brute force" T suppressing with Estradiol Injections. But, I was on a rather large dose of injection and nothing happened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am seeing my doctor in a couple weeks. I'm quite certain I will be saying to him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to seriously consider other options than Spironolactone for my anti-androgen, and if you can't, or won't, please be candid with me because I need to find someone who will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I saw him I meekly tried to talk about this. His response was "I'll ask around" and "have you considered an orchiectomy?" After much consideration, I am not ready to move towards surgery, so no orchi for me yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="i-hate-this"&gt;I hate this&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some girls can't take HRT for health reasons, but I have been unable to find any online who have had the same issue as me. To grow and lose them many times is crushing me. I really wish I could express how devastating this is. I had real boobs that made me happy for these brief moments. And I keep fucking losing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day someone tried to get frisky with me and as soon as they touched my chest I nearly started bawling right there. It killed the mood for me completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not be defined by my body. I will not be defined by my body. I will not be defined by my body. üò¢&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-04-23:/posts/2018-04-23-empty.html</guid></item><item><title>A day in the sun cleaning up</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-04-22-cleaning-up.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Warmth is finally coming. We had a warm day today, so I took Vanessa up to my old outlook where I did some cleaning up while basking in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cleaned Vanessa's wheels, they were so gross. I also finally finished replacing the weather stripping on the plastic cover for the air filter. It is a damn good seal now. haha. Vanessa smells way better now, and I think I can stop worrying about it. I concluded the reason she smelt bad was because I failed to put that cover on properly once and bam, smelly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also spent some time picking up trash in the area. This spot has a strong place in my heart. Each chapter of my life I have memories here and I like to keep it clean. I still have a lot more to pick up, the last time I did it was a while ago. But, it made me feel good when I saw a family, and later some kids, try to sit around the areas I had already cleaned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to have something to do with no pressure and also makes me feel like I did something good. I filled 5.5 grocery bags of trash, not including the shoe and car floor mat. I bet there is another 3-5 bags left.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 Apr 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-04-22:/posts/2018-04-22-cleaning-up.html</guid></item><item><title>A moment of clarity</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-04-09-some-clarity.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I awoke from something awkward and awful. Half past five in the morning is a lovely time to be filled with dread and unknowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I envisioned my behavior at my last job as toxic. I wanted to be a good monkey, but I failed. Then I found my way inside the last two years. I see myself from a rather disappointed place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start and stop my medications. I feel invigorated and productive only to crash into binge watching and internet lurking. I am sociable and friendly before cowering alone. I hold hope tightly then let it spill across the bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="i-try-and-try-again-to-find-firm-ground-but-sink-every-time"&gt;I try and try again to find firm ground, but sink every time.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I a bipolar sociopath?&lt;br&gt;
A depressed emotionally detached chronic pain addict?&lt;br&gt;
A ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come across intelligent and capable. I suppose those things are true, but I mean to imply I hide my chaos very well. I position myself as this caring, empathetic, selfless soul who must help others. Any hope at living selfishly is rejected in a heartbeat. I must remain trapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should hold tightly to the fact I have only been real for a year. That's it. This sensation of connection with my life is that young. As my friend said "the rest will come". I am filling in the spaces now. Finally. And I do have proof of that. So I suppose this moment is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="does-that-mean-i-am-getting-better-slowly"&gt;Does that mean I am getting better slowly?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt this moment will amount to any obvious change quickly. It may not even be defining. Maybe it is another step of many similar moments which I am building my recovery. Maybe by writing this down, and making sure I capture this moment in my mind by writing about it I will help ensure it gets added to the glue. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-04-09:/posts/2018-04-09-some-clarity.html</guid></item><item><title>What I've been up to</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-04-08-what-im-up-to.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I figured I would actually share what's going on, because I haven't been writing about this stuff enough. Partly because I am depressed. Partly because I don't know how I feel yet about sharing this stuff on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been helping my mother pack up the family house. We're selling. May parents are getting divorced and everything is finally ending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have wedged myself into my support group again and trying to have an impact. Hopefully a positive one. We'll see about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two things are taking a considerable amount of my energy. And they're also things I don't really want to talk about much on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple in the fact that it's still way too cold for me to be comfortable and I don't do anything worth writing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot wait until it gets warmer here.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 08 Apr 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-04-08:/posts/2018-04-08-what-im-up-to.html</guid></item><item><title>Voices want to sound like robots again and so what</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-04-04-robot-voices.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Voices, whether analog or digitial are again sound like they have a robot filter on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;
                &lt;iframe width="100%" height="100%"
                    src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/oTeq-3Nucc4?start=1037'

                &lt;/iframe&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happens less in analog, but I'm starting to think it is related to how much pain I am experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-04-04:/posts/2018-04-04-robot-voices.html</guid></item><item><title>Living for myself</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-03-31-for-myself.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have felt for quite some time now that I cannot live for myself. Every time I try to figure it out I end up feeling my only choice would be to end my life. Now, almost a year into reality I am questioning again if it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to believe all my actions have some other benefactor in mind which is unlikely. I tend to claim I have no friends and suck at making them. Aside from a few people, cisgender people are a strong source of envy for me so I don't end up befriending them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who reads this drivel is likely shaking their head at my bullshit. Which is fine. I don't really care. But it does make me think about what my life is actually like. To be someone in my shoes, with my bullshit, it's a lovely show isnt't it? All I ever wanted in life was to be a barefoot prancing little wood fairy but I cannot be any of those things. So this is what I settle for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am to survive all this I'm quite sure I will need to find a reason to live for myself. Will that day ever come?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 31 Mar 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-03-31:/posts/2018-03-31-for-myself.html</guid></item><item><title>hrt 4 year anniversary</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-03-24-four-years-hrt.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I forgot about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My perception of hrt has changed from a hopeful uplifting positive thing to a dark torturous painful requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate this. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 24 Mar 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-03-24:/posts/2018-03-24-four-years-hrt.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
