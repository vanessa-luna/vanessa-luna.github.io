I have this drive to be something of a martyr, a public figure or at least a devout public servant. All of me screams in anger about my situation while dragging my stupid life towards this goal of living with a purpose designed to serve others and not myself. I am fine with this aim. I've never expected much for my life, at least not in a real way. I had small hopes before but nothing like this. This I am because a future in this body is bleak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pain limits me from having the life I always dreamed of. I'm capable of that dream, but not with this pain. I can't simply power through the pain. My prognosis is slow decay. And while I am trying hard to be as healthy as possible I cannot change everything at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write laying in bed wondering if I will conquer this. If I will find myself in another two, five years laughing with my hands on my hips pain free and able to live the life I always dreamed of. Maybe I'm just getting one step closer to acceptance of the life I am trapped in. Pushing myself beyond limits for everyone but myself. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-03-15:/posts/2018-03-15-my-body-my-pain.html</guid></item><item><title>My Transition... so far</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-03-12-my-transition.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I haven't been writing about transition specific things, and I figured I should. So here is an introduction to my transition...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-use-the-word-transsexual"&gt;I use the word transsexual&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is very important to distinguish between gender(expression) dysphoria, and body(sex) dysphoria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expression dysphoria is about the outisde, how we present ourselves to the world. Sex dysphoria is about the relationship with the body. In the cases where they seem to overlap it is even more important to determine which of these dysphoria roots the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I like to remind people, the universe is free to experience all kinds. There are some people with no sex dypshoria, some people with a little, and some with a lot. Combine that idea with expression dysphoria and we can have a huge spectrum of how people relate to their body and the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I feel my primary issue is my relationship with my body, I use the word transsexual to describe this facet of my life. Expression, while important and I want to get better at it, has not felt like the driving cause of this change in my life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-hate-expression"&gt;I hate expression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mostly because I suck at it. I wish I Was good at it, but I don't think that is my purpose in life. I still struggle with buying clothing, sharing my feelings, and generally allowing who I am to exist in the world. Thanks DPDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try actively on a regular basis to fight this. I want to be expressive. I wish I could dance, and simply put my emotions in the world. But it's pretty fucking hard. I can't even buy clothing for myself without it being a major thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason expression is hard is because I still see myself as male mostly, in mirrors. My lack of breasts also effects my relationship with expression. Because it is so difficult to remain on my medications, I have grown and lost my breasts four times now. And they may never come back now. We'll see. It is not that I have small breasts, there is quite literally so little tissue on my body you wouldn't know I had breasts. It breaks my heart and makes me feel inadequate. I never wanted a large chest, I just wanted A chest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bleh"&gt;Bleh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to not read the narrative. It's boring and unintseresting. But I figured I'd right it down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I write a bit more about my transition. I hope it pushes me to make more progress because I don't want to remain stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-narrative"&gt;My narrative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst acknowledging my chronic pain for the first time in early 2012 I began exploring my strugles with expression. After a number of months it became clear to me I was drawn to what we call "feminine" expression. In the following months I drew out the reality that, it was my body not being female which distressed me. I then knew I would need to medically transition from male to female. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first thing I was confident about was my distaste for facial hair. I started laser hair removal treatments. It took another handful of months before I could get access to hormone treatement. Spring 2014 I started Estradiol and Spironolactone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following year was mostly okay. I had quit my job and was focusing on my transition. However an unwarrented arrest and the increase of my chronic pain threw shit into the trenches. January 2015 I tried to end my life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully a friend of mine was willing to take the responsibility of sending me to a hospital. Through her insistence I was registered as female, that event is a major factor in my recovery. I spent a month or so in a partial hopsitalization program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after I left that program, I worked for one more year at a startup, learning later it was a true pity hire. But I was fired because my health deteriorated and they sucked at communcation and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that year of working, I played with my hormone dose a lot. I had attempted to end my life because I had found out my hormone treatment made my chornic pain worse. After trying all kinds of dosing options I concluded I needed to stay on hormones despite the increase of chronic pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I left my job, I was beginning my new chapter of van life. I bought a van in late spring 2016 and spent the summer converting it to a livable space. I did a trip to Nova Scotia, a trip to the Carolinas. I spent the winter in MA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017 I left for Florida at the beginning of spring. It was on this trip I became real. For the summer in MA, I began injections for my estrogen. I was very happy with the switch. I felt good. I made another trip to Florida in the end of fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 I came back to MA in January. Here I shall stay until the summer and what's next I don't know. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 12 Mar 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-03-12:/posts/2018-03-12-my-transition.html</guid></item><item><title>I just had a glimpse of how I might gain weight</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-03-11-glimpes-of-fat.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I adore empathy. In turn this really means I love imagination. It is through using my imagination and wholly attempting to live it, I am able to create such empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, after gourging on food, I went out for another snack. As I was eating I realized my stomach was still mostly full, but I was cramming it in anyway. But I wanted to eat. I was compelled to eat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it flashed before my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hate being skinny, so I finally pushed to be a person who eats a lot so I can gain weight. I start the habit of eating more and more. Eventually I can't stop. I have been so skinny my whole life I don't really care I now have a little too much weight. And suddenly, I'm well overweight but still sitting down and eating another food because in my mind, I am so satisfied I am not underweight. I will never be underweight again. Ever. So I eat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if this means I am going to start the path of finally gaining weight. Not exactly in the extreme way this day dream played out, but still. Or is this simply a bout of fleeting imagination which will result in nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to see it as a sign, but I'd rather make it sign.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 11 Mar 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-03-11:/posts/2018-03-11-glimpes-of-fat.html</guid></item><item><title>Mew, give it time.</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-03-09-mew-doodle.html</link><description>&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mew doodle do, I&amp;#39;m thinking of you.
I hope that today you&amp;#39;re feeling less blue.
Cause in a couple days everything will be alright!
The clouds will clear and you will jeer,

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Mar 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-03-09:/posts/2018-03-09-mew-doodle.html</guid></item><item><title>Stuck in MA</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-03-05-stuck.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So, due to many reasons, I have decided to stay in MA until the summer hits. I know. SADFACE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the plan is to focus on selling stuff, getting my kitchen built in Vanessa, and continuing my other plans as much as I can while still in MA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do plan to bug out sometimes. I have some places in New England I should see, and hope I have the money and time to do that. But I'll have to wait until at least May to do anything like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a shift in plans, but I shall make the best of it. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-03-05:/posts/2018-03-05-stuck.html</guid></item><item><title>Drive Shaft Bearing</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-03-01-drive-shaft-bearing.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Sigh. so the Wheel bearings didn't fix the issue I was feeling. Turns out it was the center drive shaft bearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had made assumptions it would be the bearings, instead of investigating deeply. And while I needed to do that bearing anyway, I felt disappointed. Anyway, Vanessa is all fixed now :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-03-01:/posts/2018-03-01-drive-shaft-bearing.html</guid></item><item><title>What can I focus on to keep recovering?</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-03-01-things-to-do.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I know I address this in different ways periodcially, but here's another list which might inspire you to keep working your way towards recovery:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a quality therapist who's aim is to reduce suffering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research the topic of anxiety &amp;amp; recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and maintain a list of Life goals to direct your actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn/Practice Mindfulness/Meditation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise, Eat Healthy, Drink water, Sleep well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a few mantras to help instill your dreams/goals/beliefs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn about relationships/shame/vulnerability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin a new hobby that will help you meet new people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go outside on a daily basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read books instead of browse the internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List all of your anxieties in terms of what you fear, then write a list of actions/goals you could take to address the underlying fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-03-01:/posts/2018-03-01-things-to-do.html</guid></item><item><title>Banner Comments +</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-02-26-bcp.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So, in style of getting back into code, I made an extension for Visual Studio Code. Well I rewrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an exentions which allows you to convert text into ASCII fonts! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use these kinds of fonts in large comments to help segment my code for easy parsing. I spent a couple days tweaking and trying to get into better commit and versioning habits. Documenting was fun too. &lt;/p&gt;

We all experience thoughts about negative things. This can range from guilt to shame, to suicidality. Yikes. For someone like me, where I spent years allowing suicidal thoughts exist in my mind, it can be tough to not let them win. Here's my way of releasing those thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mantras"&gt;Mantras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not my body. I am not my thoughts. I am something more than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've seen me write this before. But this helps separate myself from the issue directly. Because...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not the problem. The problem is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great sentence one of my older therapists shared with me. I beleive it comes from &lt;code&gt;Narrative Therapy&lt;/code&gt;, which I love and you should check out if you're interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/kill-a-part.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="release"&gt;Release&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is to find a way to release these thoughts into the world. If kept inside, the boil, ferment, spoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to a rubber duck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes from the programming industry. The tale goes, that a programmer should first try to explain their problem to a rubber duck before seeking a real person. This is because, simply attempting to explain the problem outside your head will help you lead to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write it down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to a rubber duck, writing it down is a safe easy way to let it out. This comes with some fun variations. If you change the audience you imagine yourself writing for, you will process the problem differently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try writing your problem to:
    1. Your self
    2. Your best friend
    3. Your mother
    4. A support group
    5. The entire internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised how you change your wording to explain the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share with a real human&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find someone you trust and feel safe with. Make sure to ask yourself: "What kind of response am I hoping for?" Are you essentailly seeking validation, to vent, or are you looking for solutions?&lt;/p&gt;

You feel you cannot get out of this hole you are so deep in. When you're down here, at the bottom, what does it take to get up? How do you begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="breathe"&gt;Breathe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at a high level of an approach to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desire - do you even want to recover?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore - seek out new information to help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage - actively pursue recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat - Cycle, rest, plateau, climb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know. You've heard it before. That's precisely the issue isn't it! Some of these concepts really help but sometimes we are in a resistive mood. We get stuck in a stubborn place and stand still begrudgingly. Change is hard. So read on anyway. Remind yourself of these things or learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this post focuses on DPDR, the issues are abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-are-you-now"&gt;Where are you now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body, your brain is built for dissociation. We know this because you experience it. Some people struggle with anger. Others, maybe like yourself, struggle with depression. What a wonderous thing to accept the way you are rather than despise it. Try as you might, but you will never experience the other side. THIS IS OK. What a world it would be if you could change on a dime, or there wasn't an infinite possibility of humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've been stuck in DPDR for so long your brain is super good at it. This is the fight. This is your struggle. You train your mind, body, and soul to resist a natural yet encouraged state of being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="desire-do-you-want-it"&gt;Desire - Do you want it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've got to want it. You've got to be willing to change who you think you are. You've got to push outside your comfort zone regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I am.&lt;br&gt;
I will never get out of this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe these thoughts, and you will, indeed, stay this way. Trapped by our history, it seems because I have been this for so long, I am unable to be any different. This is a fallacy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not my DPDR, I struggle with DPDR.&lt;br&gt;
If I can overcome this, I will be awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This peeks at the heart of identity. I am something versus I have something. Let the problem be the problem. You are not the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can find the drive and commitment to engage in your own recovery you've got the most important piece down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="explore-there-is-always-something-new-to-learn"&gt;Explore - there is always something new to learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing would be to learn a lot about habits, change, recovery, identity, shame, vulnerability. Be willing to explore any potential childhood trauma which may source this in you. Find your weak points and build your understanding. When you have the tools to repair a car it's a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly every chapter of my life I've felt like I have "tried everything." Laughable. In a universe which is unlimited, can one truly say they have tried EVERYTHING? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="engage-conquer-those-fears"&gt;Engage - conquer those fears&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then engage. With the previous thoughts in mind, ACT! I know you can do it. I know you can face your fears and be caring towards yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept the chapter you are in. You are at that critical point in the character's story where they finally say "ENOUGH!" and truly begin their quest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you begin yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="tips-for-engagnement"&gt;Tips for engagnement&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mindfulness is a super awesome help. Imagine you have three raisins. In silence, pick up one raisin. Look, touch, smell it. Put it in your mouth and chew. Don't count just chew. Don't swallow just chew. It will go down when it's ready. Follow the raisin into your stomach. Now. Pick up the next raisin and do the same thing. -- You can totally build the skill of present minded action outside of dpdr. You likely experience it in small ways already so we know you're capable of it. Now it's time you habitualize it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use a stim toy. Tungsten ring which I've had almost a decade I sometimes spin on tables and watch. Kinda like a totem from inception. I watch I zone out. When it's done I come back. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other thing is more Pavlovian. I bought a small bottle of smelly stuff. I spent a couple months imprinting positive, in the moment, connected feeling into the smell. Now, when I find myself fading I smell it to come back. It really helps. Like a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fucking go for it. I knwo you can do this. 💕&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-02-16:/posts/2018-02-16-the-plan.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
