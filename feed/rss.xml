Here is a list of ideas you can peruse for inspiration. Some of these are quite unconventional. Read carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pluck all your body hair with tweezers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice moving one eye but not the other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look up anatomy drawings and try to twitch all your muscles independently (Netter's atlas baby)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice character voices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn how to throat sing (proper name?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clean every little nook and cranny&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take something apart and put it back together again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;download Zim wiki and start your own personal wiki of your life or simply write in a journal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go down memory lane and look at your old photos from 1992&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;philosophize about time, perception of time, habits around time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice and strengthen the muscles that wiggle your ears (start with extreme eye brow lifts to identify the muscles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read books! - use the library, find an e-reader with e-ink display, borrow from friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work on a puzzle if you have the flat surface area for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design tattoos for yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look through etsy for any futures hobbies you might want to get into&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;video chat with people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;re lace your shoes with a different pattern for funzies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice Taoist masturbation/sex stuff to connect with your body in new ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn to whistle in three different ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turn off all lights, get as dark as possible, and listen. Try to identify every sound you can hear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;block out as much sound and light as you can, and imagine scary stuff happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watch a visualizer while you listen to music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice an instrument if you have one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write letters to people, hell even to strangers. Just put the letter in some random mail box. Write nice things, inspirational things, love things. Not to scare people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watch documentaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explore things you don't understand, like maybe sexuality and gender (my faves)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watch free online college lectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you watch entertainment media, have paper ready to critique it while you watch instead of simply droning out in it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice breathing intentionally, like, breathe real slow for two minutes, or breathe slow then fast or something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn origami&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy a van, convert it to an RV, quit your job and become a nomad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite pass time. Conceptualize context. Understand context. Play with context. Dive your mind into the tiniest concept of molecules and focus on water, fluidity, or really explore the fabrics nearby. Zoom out to the universe level and conceptualize the galaxies, the vastness of space time, the orbital patterns if our solar system. Think of how the moon waxes and wanes, how it effects our planet, the way it illuminates the night. Think about how what you choose to think informs your understanding of reality, what your life feels like, and how you perceive others and their actions. Context is queen.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-02-02:/posts/2018-02-02-what-to-do.html</guid></item><item><title>Are you a failure?</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-02-01-stand-up.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Or do you simply believe the thought that you are a failure? If you HAVE failed in the past, can you not find ways to get better so you don't fail the same way again in the future? Failure is common but failure only comes knowing you didn't try your best. If you try your best it should not be considered failing. You put your all into that. Those failures should really be lessons learned. An opportunity to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you have been given the challenge of DPDR in your lifetime. Others get cancer, or abuse, or spinal injuries, or schizophrenia, or others. You have been given the chance to overcome this in your life. It is not easy. But everyone has their thing. And if you can stand up, brush yourself off, look around, put those fists up and keep fighting, I know you will find a way to conquer these demons. To find out why you think you hate yourself and banish those thoughts. To find all the reasons you love yourself, how you are good, and how you want to get better. To learn to deserve the love you receive and feel worthy of the good things you are lucky to experience. If this is something you want, you'll have to find it yourself. You'll have to fight, be patient, and learn a lot of new things. But this is your life. Your only life. Will you take your own hand?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-02-01:/posts/2018-02-01-stand-up.html</guid></item><item><title>Vanessa is back</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-01-31-vanessa-back.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have Vanessa back. Things were fine. It was the belt tensioner. I should have seen this coming. I heard light squeaking in the belt the last month or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I got in and drove off. I parked, opened the door. But Vanessa kept beeping at me like I forgot something. I check. The lights are off, the key is out, why won't she shut up!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does she really miss me that much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems like there is a short somewhere, which is preventing the warning beep from stopping. I worry it's part of the ignition circuit. But it could be related to a jolt when the belt was first tossed. Maybe I have fried a fuse somewhere. I shall dig soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I am very happy to have Vanessa back in my arms.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-31:/posts/2018-01-31-vanessa-back.html</guid></item><item><title>Vanessa threw her belt twice :(</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-01-26-thrown-belt.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;On my way home, I felt it. The heat stopped coming out. The cold creeped in quickly. I noticed the battery light on the dash. The steering felt stiff, barely noticable at highway speeds but unmistakable. And finally, the temp gauge began to rise fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had thrown my drive belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened before. But not in the winter. I was already exhausted. But I found a place to stop and took out a spare belt and tools. Inside the engine bay I noticed the other belt wasn't severely damaged, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With great effort I put on the new belt. In the cold this took a while. I got in the cockpit. Key in, engine turning, and I felt something off. I go back to the engine bay and the new belt was off already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give up. It's too cold, I can't do more. I'm calling a tow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what why she can't hold a belt?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-26:/posts/2018-01-26-thrown-belt.html</guid></item><item><title>Shedding responsibility and happy about it</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-01-26-transition-team.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For a few years I was a pseudo leader at a support group in my area for transgender people. I was the legally responsible emissary for a couple of years. I have since left and failed to hand over responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to a recent meeting and spoke with someone who I am excited about handing the reigns over to. Well, they already had them a bit. So I'm more like empowering them and validating their value by giving them responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sad, for in a way, I never truly got to exercise the value I carried for the support group before I left. In my unreality, I was always too anxious and shameful to engage in the way I could have. So I watched and prodded from a place in the back, rather than right in the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired to do something of value before I leave again, I am taking on a couple of responsibilities to get the group admin stuff moving again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to let go. I am happy there are others with similar views as me. I am happy knowing I made an impact on a group I feel is absolutely vital to my community.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-26:/posts/2018-01-26-transition-team.html</guid></item><item><title>Another sick day</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-01-25-another-sick-day.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;No vomiting this time thankfully. However right before I set out to a friend's place I felt so dizzy and nauseous I had to lie down. I did the off and on sleeping thing for about four hours. And after some food and gobs of water I began to feel better. It's 2am right now. I have to do things tomorrow. Ugh. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-25:/posts/2018-01-25-another-sick-day.html</guid></item><item><title>Burning memorabilia while purging</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-01-21-burning.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I burnt thousands of pages. A lot with sensitive medical data I would not like floating around. Others simply records of experiences I've lived in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This being the second time burning like this, I felt more prepared for the shift in perspective afterwards. Symbolically I destroy ties to the past I used to care deeply for. I will always be an archivist. However, my urges to do so with physical things is all but extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me to thinking about what forms of physical archival fits my new perspective on life. Here's my list so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewelry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tattoos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instant Film Pictures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trinkets small enough to enclose a fist over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practical items (tools, storage, lifestyle enhancements)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously the trend is keeping clutter out of life. Using small and or practical items to impart the symbol into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am feeling it is of little use to recall all of life with great detail. Distilling key memories and placing their importance into a small or  practical item is all that is needed to remember what made you the way you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more you hold tightly to the memories, the less willing you may be to change. Too much focus on the past and you will stay there. Too much focus on the future and you may never get there. The present is the most practical place to be in any given moment. Although, never leaving the present makes it very difficult to grow and change with intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love change ^_^&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-21:/posts/2018-01-21-burning.html</guid></item><item><title>Stuck in MA for a bit.</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-01-20-stuck.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I don't know what I will write during the rest of the month, but I figured I'd at least outline what the plan is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am stuck in MA for a while. Since my parents are planning to sell the house this summer, I am spending a large chunk of my time getting rid of my crap. Ripping DVDs, throwing out stuff, donating, giving away, putting up for sale, cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also putting a lot of energy into staying away from depression and depletion. It is so easy in the winter to hibernate and do nothing because of how the cold effects my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I plan to be social with people here. I've got some people I would like to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully everything goes okay, I get back on the road before February, and things keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-20:/posts/2018-01-20-stuck.html</guid></item><item><title>Life is not hard, dealing with your self is</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-01-15-live-is-not-hard.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Seriously. Life itself is not hard. Every living creature figures out how to do it. Our body and minds are designed to keep living as long as we can. Some species have apparently survived for tens of thousands of years, and some over a million right? Life, living, not dying, is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/you-against-the-world.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with your &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; is hard. Why is it that two people can experience the same traumatic event but respond so differently? How can some bounce back while others stay crushed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/survived-every-day.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is to say, that life is not to blame. No outside force is going to save you, fix you. YOU ARE GOING TO FIX YOU. Because you can, and you will, because you fucking love yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/afraid-to-fail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is your life, this dark, scary, sad, horrifying, anxious, depressed, dissociated, mess of a life, why not do and try everything to find as much joy, happiness, playfulness, fun, love, light as possible? This is your only life! Make it what you will, not the result of giving in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/you-think-you-have-time.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All it takes is a spark, an unending flame that boils inside you to never give up, never give in, and never forget to keep pushing, to keep trying, and to explore the world and all of reality so you can find what feeds you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that spark ignites, you'll know. Once you find a way to keep that flame burning no matter how sad, depressed, anxious, or fucked up you feel, you'll know. Once you have that day, where you are down in the pits but remember, oh right, I've got this flame, this urge, this desire, this need to recovery, and take another step out, you'll know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/inspiration/you-get-better.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-15:/posts/2018-01-15-live-is-not-hard.html</guid></item><item><title>Questions from after a suicide attempt</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-01-13-asking-questions.html</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was written in the midst of a partial hospitalization after a serious bout with suicidality. Never stop asking yourself questions. These questions helped bring me to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="life-is-not-hard-dealing-with-yourself-is"&gt;Life is not hard, dealing with yourself is.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billions of people have lived and died all with their own experience of life, reality. Is it that life is hard intrinsically or that your experience, your perspective, is what creates the challenges you face? Is it intrinsically difficult to alter the way you respond to the minutia of what life brings? Can we assess our attachment to certain behaviors, thoughts, reactions, and make choices regarding their relevancy? Have you ever watched someone succeed at something you fail at and wonder how they are so lucky? What causes us to respond to events the way we do? and how do you close the gap to respond desirably?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it that some others do not struggle the way I do? Are my problems permanent? Which are conquerable? Which can only be managed? Can you approach your problems from many angles to determine which type your problems truly are? And how is it that others simply move forward after traumas, hardship, and problems? What do they know that you don't? Is it as simple as saying I will choose this response? What even makes an even something you will struggle with? How long does it take for you to generally get beyond the struggle and moved forward? Can you find the tools to help minimize the amount of time you struggle so you can move forward? Is this related to change and how we cope with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between your self and other selves? Is it possible to see how another responds to certain stimuli and calculate the distance between your response and theirs? How often is the distance merely a  formation of habit? Are habits all that hard to change? How often is the distance a gap in knowledge or awareness of a concept? Is it really hard to open yourself to learning something new?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dissociation-and-its-role-in-my-life"&gt;Dissociation and its role in my life.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of my memories from childhood contain dissociation. I always felt shuffled along by the whims of my kith, doing and being what they wanted me to be. This sense of always watching and always thinking led me to the conclusions I have formed and the perspective I have acquired. I have wisdom because I have never truly lived my life. My sharing is never just for my expression. I live in the windows of others and calculate language to account for them, not me. I try not to dissociate. My transition is about trying to take hold of my association. I only ever feel associated alone. I don't feel like I can ever get rid of my dissociation. What I am, what I know, has crafted such a foundation that cannot be rebuilt. My dissociation is me. Without it I would be someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="positivity"&gt;Positivity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I have limited my dissociation some in the last three years. Before was a total haze. Proof I can make progress. But how much more do I need? I have eliminated my judgments of others. I have found my sympathy for myself. I can understand my language choices better to accurately reflect my understandings and be heard by others. I sometimes have gender euphoria! I have support from nearly all my kith. My kith appreciate what I have to offer despite my reservations of compliments. I can take compliments without them knocking me down or sounding ill-received.  I was able to participate on my first day at this program. However my engagement was nearly all removed from the actual group. I didn't shut down those that chose to talk to me. I did not panic.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-13:/posts/2018-01-13-asking-questions.html</guid></item><item><title>Sick day</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-01-11-sick.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A remarkable thing happened. I woke up at my mother's house the first day and felt nauseous. I threw up a couple times and spent all day in bed. Yuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why? If this type of sick occurred in Vanessa it would have been horrifying. I am not prepared for that. I should be prepared for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I get myself back together for this week. I've got a ton of shit going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugh. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-11:/posts/2018-01-11-sick.html</guid></item><item><title>A very social month. Today I part north.</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-01-05-a-social-month.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In the last 38 days, I was social 29 of them. This is a lot for me. I have never spent so much time and energy meeting new people in my life. Van life gave me this month. Van life gave me all the growth I experienced the month of December. Oh and all the cool people I met too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights because of my openness to meeting new people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I performed in a concert!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went busking for the first time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found a boy I was attracted to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found that sexuality doesn't have to hurt as bad as it used to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I realized more confidence than I've ever had before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can now meet new people without anxiety (except cis girls, you scary yo ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel so different about what I am now. What I offer to the world. Who I am willing to be. Who I can be. So shit. Thanks Jacksonville, St Augustine, and Orlando Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never would have changed like this without Vanessa. In the face of so much change, without proximity of friends, I had to push to learn to make new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-3-vanessa"&gt;I &amp;lt;3 Vanessa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside my growth, I saw every single person I met grow too. New confidences found in every one of them. This makes me feel very good. Especially when I can have an impact on my trans sisters. Nothing makes me happier than seeing them grow, and find inner strength and happiness. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what I am now, thanks girl. I am so fucking grateful for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-cold-of-the-north"&gt;The cold of the North&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am beginning my ascent today. In six days time I shall be back in Mass enduring the insufferable hell of winter. Each day I will get colder and colder. And hopefully not depressed along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out for some more posts. I'll have a lot of time to write this week. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-05:/posts/2018-01-05-a-social-month.html</guid></item><item><title>Integrating a CDN for image hosting part 1</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-01-01-cdn.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Super excited. I recently created an account at Cloudinary.com for their free account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want to switch over to a CDN for image hosting because my git project should not host all those images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I accomplished:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I created an account which gives me enough free space to be fine for another good while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote a python script that allows me to parse through all my images and thumbnails and uploads them to the CDN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I created a plugin for Pelican that parses all my files and replaces image references with the CDN domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are reading this article, then all images are being served from the CDN :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate img upload script into build process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update .gitignore to never add the images again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove all images from the git repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whats left:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upgrade to new verion of Pelican to utilize symlink feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update thumbnail creation script to account for symlink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure I only have one copy of image on my harddrive finally!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel very good I finally did this. It's been a long time coming.
