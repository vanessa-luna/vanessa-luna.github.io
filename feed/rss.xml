I have seen many and missed out on a few. Now I must take a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This search has exhausted me. Given the time I have other things to take care of. Then I will ascend as the weather warms and continue my search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this means I will start writing more. I have been depressed lately. And in excess pain. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2019-04-01:/posts/2019-04-01-searching.html</guid></item><item><title>My theme song</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2019-03-17-theme-song-recording.html</link><description>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="history"&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I begun writing the song shortly after I got Vanessa. It took about 9-12 months to finish it. I know I finished it before I became real. And sharing it with people definitely helped me become real. I am confident the latter half of the song came after my third trip in Vanessa where I was in Florida for a while. &lt;/p&gt;

You don't need to justify your needs, your questions, your desires to every person. When I felt undeserving of everything I always felt I had to explain myself in order to appease others, to create a reason for me to be valid. But as I have been reaching out to a lot of strangers lately I have been finding myself writing out those sentences explaining myself, and then realizing they are not necessary and deleting them. It feels good. It feels good to know I care about myself more than I used to. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2019-03-07:/posts/2019-03-07-explaining-yourself.html</guid></item><item><title>I am without steam</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2019-01-09-without-steam.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am ever drifting through the days. I am tired of where I am. I am tired. I have so many things to do and I think I am nearing the end of life with Vanessa. Although every time I feel this I go on another couple months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not been writing much which upsets me. I have no routine other than sleeping a lot and lying down. IS this the increase in my hormones? Is it depression? Hopefully moving on to another city will help determine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OH, also I have not been to a PT in a few weeks, first time in months. Maybe this is the issue...&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2019-01-09:/posts/2019-01-09-without-steam.html</guid></item><item><title>A jam packed day with a little turbulence</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-12-30-excitement.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a wild experience. A number of things happened which trickle into tomorrow, so some of this will be about new years eve day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ancient-city-poets"&gt;Ancient City Poets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the third time I've performed here. The last time was almost a year and a half ago when I became real. This time I planned. I was going to say something vulnerable and I wrote a poem specifically because I was going to perform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a class="internal" href="{filename}2018-12-20-waves.md"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Amongst the Waves&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="internal" href="{filename}2018-07-10-sorrow.md"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sorrow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a preface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparing my preface I realized something. I am not bad at vulnerability. Van life taught me so much about resiliance. I am not generally capable of holding myself together. I can be vulnerable at the right time with the right people. My body may not like being vulnerable, but I know how to push through it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt good to say those things and be that clear about it. I also grew fonder of the poem Sorrow. I really like it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a fist bump and nice words afterwards and a strange conversation outside. The morning after at a coffee shop, someone recognized me from the poetry reading and complimented me. I told him I play my violin so maybe he'll see me tonight. I got two cards because of the poetry reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="street-performing"&gt;Street performing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I setup shop in arguably on of the best spots downtown. Only ten minutes in or so and I had mad ten dollars. A drummer showed up asking when I would leave, but then asked if we could play together. I was into it. Never played with a drummer before. So I played mostly video game music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drew crowds. Fantastically, Mike Tyson's Punch Out got us the biggest applause. WHAT? Are you serious? I don't really get it. But hey, we made 37 dollars in about a half hour or so. He gave me 20. I left to rest and eat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled over to my favorite spot. The end of Saint George street. It is very intimate and loads of people pass to go to the parking garages. I doubld my money there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some interesting things happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A younger woman stopped with a polaroid camera. Turns out she left the picture in my case. That was a nitfty gesture!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A woman recorded me for a moment, dropped some money and asked me to play happy birthday. I totally nailed it with double stops and thinking the words in my head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A woman and I made nice eye contact one moment and ten seconds later she comes back to ask what I was playing. She also plays the violin but with effects pedals and performs in other settings. She is only two hours away, on my path, and willing to hang out when I get there!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some girls started dancing in front of me almost celtic like. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-morning-after"&gt;The morning after&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt really good after all that success so I stopped by a local place to get drinks. I went there because I know some people who work there. I drank a bit more than I should have so when I got to the van I passed out with a light on! Couple that with a dying batter and alternator issues and the battery was dead by morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had someone hooked up to me for 30 minutes, no good. I read the voltage of my battery after and it read 0.4v haha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am safe where I parked and a friend will hlep me tomorrow. Then I will focus on replacing the alternator geeze.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Dec 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-12-30:/posts/2018-12-30-excitement.html</guid></item><item><title>Jackonsville Beaches Pier [rise]</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-12-28-rise.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/sun/2018-12-28-rise-jacksonville-beaches-pier-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He was kind, hard to understand, and curious to help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He openly talked about having cancer, living on a boat, being harrassed by police, and of experiences being a sniper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I listened I began thinking about an old high school thing I used to play with &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which tense are you in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past, Present, Future, we bring forth each of these into our mind, into the present. This man was obviously trapped by his mind constantly bringing the past into the present. Fill right now with all the horrors of the past. And his horrors would be devilishly hard to let go of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's what I found myself talking with him about, letting go. How that old life is not this life. I told him of my journey some about trying to find myself and how that is the best thing in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly it got very dark when I asked him this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You had a role to play back in the military, what role do you play now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dying of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to say much after that in the moment. I don't know the extent of his circumstance, and as much as I wanted to inspire hope of survival it didn't seem approrpiate. We hugged. A number of times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think to my character sheet. I think about why I am being the way that I am. I feel resolute in this moment. I feel connected to my purpose as designed by the confluence of my experiences and my conscious choices. It is the only way I feel strong enough to keeping moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 23 Dec 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-12-23:/posts/2018-12-23-kindness.html</guid></item><item><title>Jacksonville Main St. Bridge [set]</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-12-21-set.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/sun/2018-12-21-set-jacksonville-main-st-bridge-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The tide is shifting and you are ready. 
Swelling, not only inside, 
your eyes are wide open this time.

Swayed not by the crash nor pulled by the tow.
For a moment lament the strength you now hold.
Not too long ago you&amp;#39;d have been swept away
as you play amongst the waves.

Not only is this a strange place, they have a free boat ride over the river and a tour guide to tell you some cool stuff about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matanzas is apparantly a word for slaughters. So there is a whole region here in Florida named after slaughters. And it doesn't freak anyone out. I can't think of any English named places like "The masacre" "The Killings" "The deaths" "The Slaughters"... apparently there are some thigns like that in other countries. But how strange it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently this little fort never had to kill anyone and succesfully shooed away all ptoential invaders. Build to protect the southern side of St Augustine from attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a nice and relaxing experience. There was also a small path to walk which is where the tree picture comes from. Gosh the nature around here is so different. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-12-12:/posts/2018-12-12-fort-matanzas.html</guid></item><item><title>Matanzas Inlet, ~ St Augustine [set]</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-12-12-set.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/sun/2018-12-12-set-matanzas-inlet-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
