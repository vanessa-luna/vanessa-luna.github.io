Why? Why might you ask? Because it's been FUCKING COLD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in Jax and it's still too cold. What the hell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want to catch up on my past events. Capture the lingering emotions from weeks gone by before they are totally gone, but going backwards is hard when I don't have much steam in my machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will get to it. And yes I back date things. This is my public journal, not something with integrity 😅&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-11-16:/posts/2018-11-16-catching-up.html</guid></item><item><title>Priorities :: Avoidance</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-11-16-priorities-part1.html</link><description>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priorities. This morning I am surrounded. Their chattering cackle drowning me in cacophony. The din begging me to answer the question: &lt;em&gt;Who are you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="info-span" style="background-color:#fff; font-size:.8rem"&gt; This post is specficially for me, without much concern for the position of others. This somehow feels different to me as I write this than other recovery posts. I hope there is still value for my readers through extrapolation&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id="dammit-why-does-it-always-boil-down-to-that-question_1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dammit, why does it always boil down to that question?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who am I? Fuck. No one likes answering that question. Well some of us. And fine, I like the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of answering it. Making the choice to be someone is a little too daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priorities are a good way of determining who someone is. What do they care about? Why do they care about? What do they spend their time thinking about? What do they do with their time? All of those questions could be answered through the lense of priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we avoid answering this existential question and still determine our priorities? How would we do that? What other frames or lenses, or, as I like to say, windows can we add to this perspective to help us decide our priorities without exhausting ourselves into existential hell? Hopefully, I work it out by the end of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-important-to-you"&gt;What is important to you?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already know what is important to me, I choose not to fight for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I know what is important to me? Feeling. Intuition. Dreams. Why do I know I am avoiding them? Because I sit on my phone allowing the habit loops of click after click create a barrier around me to protect me. A haze of moment to moment positivity which requires no effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a dream of doing something meaninful for the transgender community. I want to give something powerful, big, and impact many lives. Ever since I knew I had to transition I felt a fire raging for me to ensure no one else experiences what I did. This is important to me. It is a priority. I can't simply do it though. This kind of dream takes building, steps. Unfortunately for me, the biggest challenge I have in getting there is conquering my body. I must find a way to live inside a human body, eat drink sleep and compensate for its failings. I suck at this right now. And so one priortiy exposes another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In following this path towards a huge goal like this, other ideas and smaller priorities pop up along the way. Because of this larger goal I can plug them in to ensure my smaller priorities also in some way bring me closer to the bigger goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am to give back meaninfuly, I need to conquer my social anxiety. How will I do this? One way is for me to busk with my violin. Standing on the street playing music for strangers requires me to remain in my world thinking only of me while in the presence of others. If I am to give back I must be able to speak up for what I need given my limitations. One way to get better at that is to go on dates and spend time with new people always pushing my limits. I choose to draw out these other priorities to help me along the other. All points converging at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-am-i-still-avoiding-my-priorities"&gt;Why am I still avoiding my priorities?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I have been watching youtube and using reddit to an obscene amount, well, for my standards. Because I know I have all these things I want to do I feelt guilty and lightly ashamed when I use these services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this article because I desparately want to find my way back into inspiration and commitment. I hope by writing this down I find the outreached arm of my dreams and grab hold again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quote I found suggested this idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't say &lt;code&gt;I don't have time&lt;/code&gt; say &lt;code&gt;It is not a priority&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool. Okay, so "I don't have time to do this thing" really means "I am not prioritizing this thing". I don't have time to make my bed really means making my bed is not a priority. If it was a priority you would find a way. But I can also look at this another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have time. Period. Life is short. Weeks fly by. Months are gone and next year is already here. I get to Jacksonville and feel releived to know I plan to spend 6 weeks here only to realize I have so much planned I cannot afford to rest. What the heck!? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a priority. I need to tell myself this, not in hoping to determine my priorities, but to remind myself of what NOT to do, because I already know them. I already know what my priorities are and I am getting bogged down by all the junk that means nothing to me. The habits that drain me of my life, that rob me of my goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels to me, by framing these two phrases this way I am putting myself in the window of someone who &lt;code&gt;does&lt;/code&gt; know know their priorities rather than always triyng to determine if they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-know-my-priorities"&gt;I know my priorities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat better and drink more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise and conquer my body's pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get better at the violin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take care of and improve Vanessa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read books and craft things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conquer identity issues and anxieties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the way I will give back to the trans community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything I do must help me towards one of these goals. Otherwise what am I doing? There is no mystery for me. There is no hemming or hawing over what I want. I know. And I am going to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No such thing as spare time, &lt;br&gt;
no such thing as free time,&lt;br&gt;
no such thing as down time,&lt;br&gt;
there is only life time.&lt;br&gt;
Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-11-16:/posts/2018-11-16-priorities-part1.html</guid></item><item><title>Finding Anger</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-11-11-finding-anger.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It is time I find anger again. I hate to say it. And I hate anger. I don't like it, I don't like feeling it, and I have been pretty good at not needing it for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have known for some time I need anger. For years I have been confronted time and time again where anger would have served me well. All these years avoiding anger has led me to believe this about anger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anger is one of the clearest expressions of ego and sense of self&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all emotions, anger tends to come when empathy is way down, and someone reacts purely based off their own narrative, their own perspective. Anger, in most cases seems to say &lt;code&gt;"I care about me and my world more than anything else right now"&lt;/code&gt;. Maybe this is simply a reaction to my own struggle iwth life. There are likely many forms of anger and ways to describe it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-must-i-find-anger"&gt;Why must I find anger?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I have concluded the same thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me to succeed I must fix my body&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to fix my body I must learn to be angry about my pain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current and lifelong response to my pain has always been to shrivel. To retreat from the pain, the sadness, and avoid everything. This will not work for me if I am to conquer the pain. I have to be angry when I hurt too much. And then I have to use that anger to get up and fix it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to find this anger because it hides behind some of the core struggles I have with my past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I hate what I am
I hate my pain
I hate my history
I hate being trans
I hate being smart
I hate being &amp;quot;pretty&amp;quot;
I hate human expression
I hate human behavior
I hate culture
I hate life
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These ideas live inside me like a rodent. Festering and spreading feces all over impossible to catch beyond the right bait and trap. How can I be angry when I do not truly honestly give a shit? How can I be angry when I lost my sense of self at such a young age? You telling me I have to &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; a self? Fuck that, how do I even fucking decide who to be then if I can be anything? The whole game is so fucking pathetic and lame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My anger will only come once I actually care about my life. Whatever that fucking is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still live for others. I must. Because it is the only real reason I can justify liviing right now. Most of the time that is enough. Fine. My life matters more to others than to me, and they would be sad if I left, so live. Fine. Trying to find a reason for myself is still elusive. I live in Vanessa hoping to find it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plainly do not think I will find my anger until I find a reason to live for myself. And who ever really finds a reason to live for their self? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Real isn't how you are made"&lt;/code&gt; said the Skin Horse. &lt;code&gt;"It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long long time, not just to play with you, but really loves you, then you become real".&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Does it hurt?"&lt;/code&gt; Asked the Rabbit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Sometimes"&lt;/code&gt; said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. &lt;code&gt;"When you are real you don't mind being hurt."&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"&lt;/code&gt; he asked, &lt;code&gt;"or bit by bit?"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"It doesn't happen all at once,"&lt;/code&gt; said the Skin Horse. &lt;code&gt;"You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are real you can't be ugly except to people who don't understand."&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"I suppose you are real?"&lt;/code&gt; Said the rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the skin horse only smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"The boy's uncle made me real"&lt;/code&gt; he said. &lt;code&gt;"That was a great many years ago; but once you are real you can't become unreal again. It lasts for always".&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rabbit sighed. He thought it would be a long time before this magic called real would happen to him. He longed to become real, to know what it felt like; and yet the idea of growing shabby and losing his eyes and whiskers was rather sad. He wished that he could become it without these uncomfortable things happening to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thoughts"&gt;thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this in &lt;a class="external" href="https://shop.amandapalmer.net/collections/misc/products/art-of-asking-book"&gt;Amanda Palmer's book "The Art of Asking"&lt;/a&gt;. She uses these quotes from the Velveteen Rabbit near the end of her book to drive home one of the central ideas of the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming real, breaking away from fear, learning to be a whole-hearted human takes effort, time, and most of all love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us are not so lucky to be born real. We all must truly learn this. You do not need to suffer from depersonalization/derealization to not be real. I've been so lucky to have even a cisgender friend talk about her becoming a real person at almost 30 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It almost seems like we all experience a form of unreality until we figure it out. For some it is like DPDR, others, its a shallow existence essentially riding the rails of life, others a subtle fear keeps you in line, and so many other ways to not feel real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I want to make sure is clear, is that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-child-who-needs-to-really-love-you-in-order-to-become-real-is-yourself"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the child who needs to really love you in order to become real is yourself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Nov 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-11-08:/posts/2018-11-08-velveteen-rabbit.html</guid></item><item><title>An update to my dissociation</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-11-06-dissociation-update.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a mess of a writing. I have been talking with others about dissociation. And I have been paying more attention to the role it plays in my life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-am-real-no-doubt-about-that"&gt;I am real. No doubt about that.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I am still not done. I am not fully me. I need to keep building who I am. Right now I find myself dissociation in the only arena that truly matters: When I meet new people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I notice how my personality, my expression clams up like crazy around new people. Still timid about rejection sure. Those I am more interested in pose a greater threat. More so, I am afraid to make choices with consequences. Because I don't yet know who I am I clam up and feel disconnected when I need to make those decisions with new people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondarily, is the issue of how much "help" a person needs. When it is clear to me the person I am with is struggling with something, I easily bring out my &lt;code&gt;i n s p i r a t i o n&lt;/code&gt; and fill the interaction with it. However when someone doesn't obviously need that I don't really know who I want to be. In this insecurity I again clam up and feel removed. I am shy, reserved, and timid to take any steps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="progress-though"&gt;progress though&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I am making progress. I have examples where I have been the one to take a step forward. To ask for something I want and see what happens. To say something about a person which may be hurtful or amazing with not a clear answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggle the most around the issue of sexuality and intimacy. I clearly want that. But I am not yet sure on what terms, and how I want it to happen. I need touch, but am always afraid of asking for it. I tell myself I would rather build a strong network of people who like and respect me, than to potentially lose alliances in the name of sex. Sex after all isn't that important to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="non-disruptive-dissociation"&gt;non-disruptive dissociation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I still expereince episodes of disconnection, they do not bother me so. Because I am still real. I am not dissociating into depersonalization, but retreating due to fear. And fear, is the entire beast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently with an older friend who has had one hell of a life. He's lived in many countries, had successfull life, relationships, and freedom of expression. He makes it painfully clear how someone with a less shameful/fearful childhood cannot truly grasp the struggle of fighting through DPDR. Sometimes it really hurts to listen to his stories. Sometimes it hurts even more when he tries to give me answers which are not so easy for me to perform. My foundation is different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is the point. My starting point is fundamentally different than people without a lifelong history of DPDR. My basement, my foundation starts there. And this is what I must carry with me as I build the mansion on top of it. I will always be fighting it in some sense. Thankfully I can see the end of the build. The mansion is complete and I rarely am effected by the roots. I have already seen so much progress. And I know in another five years or so I will be drastically different. I will conquer the effects of my foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just gotta keep fighting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 06 Nov 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-11-06:/posts/2018-11-06-dissociation-update.html</guid></item><item><title>My violin is different!</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-11-03-violin-changes.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nut raised and whatnot
New Bridge
New Bow hair
New Strings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new strings, Zyex, were operatic, harmonious, yet howling. They sound great with legato direct sound. However spiccicato seemed impossible. The strings would squeal with my light touches. It was horrific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am backdating this post, but I played on them for weeks and nothing changed. So I gave up and returned to the Correlli Strings I had before. Such a difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even with the old strings on my violin sounds so much better. Strings are, as Jane says, and expensive experiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't wait to buy a new violin case, and get a carbon fiber bow. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-11-03:/posts/2018-11-03-violin-changes.html</guid></item><item><title>Halloween Parade in Richmond</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-31-halloween-parade.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a parade. I didn't know what to expect. I thoguht it was just some bicyclists, not a full halloween parade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up front in the parade was a transmasculine person on stilts, topless, body painted with a trans flag cape written "Stop killing trans people".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the parade until I got back to Vanessa. I was a little surprised how much the sight impacted me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about how that imagery might effect cis people. How that courage could have a lasting impact. It certainly is having an impact on me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, walking around the small park where people gathered after the parade, I saw this brave person. I approached. I thanked them for doing that and told them how important it was to me. I am very glad I took that step to say something. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-31:/posts/2018-10-31-halloween-parade.html</guid></item><item><title>Volunteering at an organization</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-27-volunteering.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This week I volunteered at an LGBT organization. This was the first time I volunteered like this. I am super glad I did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to know what to write here for I do not want to overshare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I did well. I was given a task which I took responsibility for and within three days I had finisehd it. I hope it has a helpful impact. And that's all I can hope. The last day I helped set up for an event. I even participated in the event by playing my violin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned in participating in the event I am rather reserved with new people. Proteting my emotions and the reality of my inner world. The others around me seemed very willing to expose themselves. Maybe that is because I already went through a phase of that level of vulnerability. Maybe being on the road keeps me wary. Maybe I was so timid because I am unsure of exactly how to act while I volunteer at places like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a lot for me to step into the door. I was afraid I would do something wrong or be bad, or that the org would be too dysfunctional to work with. But everything went fine. I am now excited to find other places to volunteer at, to learn from, and keep working out how to give back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This volunteering took a lot out of me. I spent an extra week in a place too cold, and found myself suffering from the pain I took on while helping. But I am so happy I did it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-27:/posts/2018-10-27-volunteering.html</guid></item><item><title>First time with dry needling</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-18-dry-needling.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I cried and cried from pain relief. Just north of DC I had an experience with a Neuromuscular therapist who was recommended to me. He did some Myofascial Release therapy and dry needling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dry needling&lt;/code&gt;, or, Trigger point needling is when someone sticks an accupuncture needle directly into a muscle that's all fucked up, wiggles the needle around a bit in hopes of getting that tissue to release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Myofascial Release&lt;/code&gt; therapy is not a massage, but when some does this slow pushing and moving on your skin or pressure into a muscle to get your body to relax tissues that have been held tight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I had an osteopath who would make me laugh with joy in relief from my pain. I thought that was remarkable, so did he. But here, with people trained in MFR and dry needling, I cry, I sob with pain relief. Even thinking about the experience will get me to well up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assesment for me is always the fun part. I get to talk about how I see things, what I know, and how my body is fucked up. Who doesn't like talking about themselves? Something I always try to get a new person like this to appreciate is what I already know. I prefer when they talk to me like I'm advanced because I love to ask questions when I don't know. This guy was amazing. He explained a whole lot. Taught me some great movements and was really kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he did some MFR. On my back I pointed out the problem area. The beginning was fine, I think he was feeling his way around. But then he went to my spine. With two hands vertically on my spine he began to pull things apart along my hinge point, which is my L1 vertabrae. Within seconds my heart began pounding. A moment later I was bwaling my eyes out. Such intense relief. And as always I was flooded with emotion about my life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my life. Caught in perpetual pain, always needing help for relief. And see, this exposes just how much pain you hold in you all the time. Accept it loser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so easy to get lost in how much I hate this life, but these sadder thoughts merely float around the core feeling of intense relief. So it's not all that bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dry-needling"&gt;Dry needling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part was scarier than I anticipated. I have had accupuncture. This is not that. This is way more trying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He chose to work on my Quadratus Lumborum. The left needle goes in. That's fine. Tiny thing goes in quick. But then, he wiggles it around and suddenly I feel exactly the muscle, exactly where the needle is and it hurts. A lot. The needle comes out and the pain beings to subside. He continues to press into the area to get those miscles to relax. Yikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards I slowly get up and do some overhead side stretches. Immediately, I am more flexible. So much more I laugh and cry at it. Instead of feeling the pull of my stretch at the attachment points on my muscles I feel the muscle tissue stretching. A distinclty differnt sensation that leaves you feeling good rather than bad. Both of us were amazed the difference one needle gave me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we went back in for a needle in the other side. MY right side hurt a LOT more. I was pulling in, cringing from the pain and crying out because it hurt so intensely. I never cry out from pain. This was hard. And it took a good while longer for the relaxing to occur after. But still the eventuality of it gave me a great comfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a long time laying down afterward feeling this new body I am in. It is not cured. It is not pain free. But the range of movement, the comfort, the filling of my body, and the minimzed intensity of my neural pain is significant, and I am joyus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue seeking treatment like this 😍&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-18:/posts/2018-10-18-dry-needling.html</guid></item><item><title>Brothertiger - High Tide</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-18-high-tide.html</link><description>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine showed me this song early in the year. Ever since this song has become my anthem. The most cathartic example of my dissociation and it is about time I shared it here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not felt so viscerally reflected by song lyrics in a very long time. I am lucky to know it. I am thankful for my friend for showing it. I hope if you struggle with DPDR you too find some connection to the words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;You run through the forest
Away from it all
You soak in the current
With your back to the wall
You swim through the tides
When the summer calls
You follow the sounds of
The waterfall

I follow to the edge
And I fall to the floor
I swim in circles
And I drift evermore
It seems I can’t remember
Who I was before
I’m floating in an ocean
That I can’t explore

But I can hang on to the surface
In flowing, oscillated time
My lungs are filling up with water
But I won’t sink to the void

I climbed to the top
Of the fiery wall
I swallowed my emotions
And embraced the fall
Exploring through the silence
Of the shadows call
I’m swimming through the current
And I feel it all
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-18:/posts/2018-10-18-high-tide.html</guid></item><item><title>Will I keep this name forever?</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-17-changing-name.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am faced with a government paperwork issue that will be much easier if I change my name legally. Another one of the issues I have been avoiding for my transition. So what should I do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked the name Luna Inanis Umbra three years ago. It came to me shortly after I remembered the meaning behind the tattoo on my hand. At the time I still felt unreal. I did not feel I was "allowed" to pick a name for myself. So I picked something symbolic so I had some complex deep answer to why that name. OTherwise I might end up picking a name because I, &lt;em&gt;shock&lt;/em&gt; "liked it". That was not okay. Since I have a love of latin, it was pretty simple to translate into something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always figured I wouldn't change it legally for a while because if I become real, I may not need the name anymore. And here I am, real for over a year, and I still am okay with it. But will I feel that way in another year, or five? That I don't know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="moving-foward"&gt;Moving foward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am stuck now thinking about how everything will be easier if I change my name, trying to decide what to do. Do I deal with my birth name on my future documents and try to change it all again later? Do I alter my chosen name to be more positive than dark? Do I choose a completely new name? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One friend suggested I could change the middle and last name to something other than Inanis Umbra. Those two are the dark parts of the name. Others seem to like Luna as a first name for me. And for the most part I like it too. I have gotten some very nice metaphor from people that are rooted in understanding my relationship to the moon. So maybe brightening the rest of the name is okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe I shouldn't be such a floof and just pick some simple girl name, change my middle name like I had originally planned with my mother, and just get it over with. Sometimes I go by Vanessa at places that ask for your name because sometimes people mess up Luna. Or maybe I pick a name with the first letter of my birth name so I can keep the same initials. Or maybe I change some of it. Fuck I don't know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel I need to make a decision soon. Every week I delay, the longer the paperwork will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sucks-having-to-pick-your-name"&gt;Sucks having to pick your name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know so many trans people who have had to pick a name, and I must say, it is much easier when your birth name is just fine. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-17:/posts/2018-10-17-changing-name.html</guid></item><item><title>Going to a support group in Maryland</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-17-md-support-group.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Something I appreciate from everyone I talk to about local support groups for transgender people is how important they are to finding a social circle. The support is nice, but having a place for us all to go so we can meet is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I went to a support group with my friend. There I found a group very similar to the one I spent so much time at. A group growing, sometimes shocked at that size, trying to find ways to support the growth, and a wide variety of expressions and peoples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the meeting I mustered up the courage to tell the whole group a brief sentence about my situation and an invite to get food. I had never done this before. My heart was pounding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I left on this trip I have yet to push myself into new spaces again. This was the first time I was with new trans faces. And I was happily rewarded and comfortable in the face of vulnerability and risk. Four people joined my friend and I for some munch and glug. I was so happy to have the opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-f-u-t-u-r-e"&gt;The F U T U R E&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke with them about my long term goals of finding a way to give back to the trans community. Something I feel I am finally ready to begin forming and putting into my plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have so many ideas in my head about where I might end up. I can feel that this vanlife journey is going to uncover how exactly I will give back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I have thought of so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tucking undergarment product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trans Lifeline operator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fund for laser hair removal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local trans outreach support organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support group fascilitator/organizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homeless shelter / halfway house exclusively for trans people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social instituation for maintaining connections within the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how much of a "in the mud" kind of person when helping people I can't imagine working on higher level things, like legislation, politics, or government. Those things are for different people than I. But who knows, maybe I will evolve into that person over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I hope I do is remember that the focus is not what I want, but what the trans community NEEDS. I am not in this for self indulgence, but for having a real impact on our lives for the better.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-17:/posts/2018-10-17-md-support-group.html</guid></item><item><title>Playing my violin in a park for the first time this year</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-16-violin-in-park.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today was weird and hard. Playing in an open space is so different than the comfort of Vanessa. This wide open park with plenty of people walking through, but very few walking by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played quietly for fear of disturbance. I felt my technical classical pieces were too high class and uppity. But I played them anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt the pressure of needing to be perfect and cringed at my mistakes. I worried I was always out of tune. Thankfully the violin was shifting to the weather and went out of tune itself a lot. OR was it??? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got too cold and my fingers couldn't play well so I played one of the harder songs and quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman from the playground 1000ft afar yelled out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was really beautiful thank you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only person to address me while I played. For someone to yell out like that really calmed me. Thank you person. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-16:/posts/2018-10-16-violin-in-park.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
