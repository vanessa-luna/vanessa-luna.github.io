Why? Why might you ask? Because it's been FUCKING COLD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in Jax and it's still too cold. What the hell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want to catch up on my past events. Capture the lingering emotions from weeks gone by before they are totally gone, but going backwards is hard when I don't have much steam in my machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will get to it. And yes I back date things. This is my public journal, not something with integrity üòÖ&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-11-16:/posts/2018-11-16-catching-up.html</guid></item><item><title>My violin is different!</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-11-03-violin-changes.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nut raised and whatnot
New Bridge
New Bow hair
New Strings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new strings, Zyex, were operatic, harmonious, yet howling. They sound great with legato direct sound. However spiccicato seemed impossible. The strings would squeal with my light touches. It was horrific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am backdating this post, but I played on them for weeks and nothing changed. So I gave up and returned to the Correlli Strings I had before. Such a difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even with the old strings on my violin sounds so much better. Strings are, as Jane says, and expensive experiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't wait to buy a new violin case, and get a carbon fiber bow. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-11-03:/posts/2018-11-03-violin-changes.html</guid></item><item><title>Halloween Parade in Richmond</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-31-halloween-parade.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a parade. I didn't know what to expect. I thoguht it was just some bicyclists, not a full halloween parade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up front in the parade was a transmasculine person on stilts, topless, body painted with a trans flag cape written "Stop killing trans people".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the parade until I got back to Vanessa. I was a little surprised how much the sight impacted me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about how that imagery might effect cis people. How that courage could have a lasting impact. It certainly is having an impact on me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, walking around the small park where people gathered after the parade, I saw this brave person. I approached. I thanked them for doing that and told them how important it was to me. I am very glad I took that step to say something. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-31:/posts/2018-10-31-halloween-parade.html</guid></item><item><title>Volunteering at an organization</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-27-volunteering.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This week I volunteered at an LGBT organization. This was the first time I volunteered like this. I am super glad I did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to know what to write here for I do not want to overshare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I did well. I was given a task which I took responsibility for and within three days I had finisehd it. I hope it has a helpful impact. And that's all I can hope. The last day I helped set up for an event. I even participated in the event by playing my violin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned in participating in the event I am rather reserved with new people. Proteting my emotions and the reality of my inner world. The others around me seemed very willing to expose themselves. Maybe that is because I already went through a phase of that level of vulnerability. Maybe being on the road keeps me wary. Maybe I was so timid because I am unsure of exactly how to act while I volunteer at places like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a lot for me to step into the door. I was afraid I would do something wrong or be bad, or that the org would be too dysfunctional to work with. But everything went fine. I am now excited to find other places to volunteer at, to learn from, and keep working out how to give back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This volunteering took a lot out of me. I spent an extra week in a place too cold, and found myself suffering from the pain I took on while helping. But I am so happy I did it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-27:/posts/2018-10-27-volunteering.html</guid></item><item><title>First time with dry needling</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-18-dry-needling.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I cried and cried from pain relief. Just north of DC I had an experience with a Neuromuscular therapist who was recommended to me. He did some Myofascial Release therapy and dry needling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dry needling&lt;/code&gt;, or, Trigger point needling is when someone sticks an accupuncture needle directly into a muscle that's all fucked up, wiggles the needle around a bit in hopes of getting that tissue to release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Myofascial Release&lt;/code&gt; therapy is not a massage, but when some does this slow pushing and moving on your skin or pressure into a muscle to get your body to relax tissues that have been held tight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I had an osteopath who would make me laugh with joy in relief from my pain. I thought that was remarkable, so did he. But here, with people trained in MFR and dry needling, I cry, I sob with pain relief. Even thinking about the experience will get me to well up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assesment for me is always the fun part. I get to talk about how I see things, what I know, and how my body is fucked up. Who doesn't like talking about themselves? Something I always try to get a new person like this to appreciate is what I already know. I prefer when they talk to me like I'm advanced because I love to ask questions when I don't know. This guy was amazing. He explained a whole lot. Taught me some great movements and was really kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he did some MFR. On my back I pointed out the problem area. The beginning was fine, I think he was feeling his way around. But then he went to my spine. With two hands vertically on my spine he began to pull things apart along my hinge point, which is my L1 vertabrae. Within seconds my heart began pounding. A moment later I was bwaling my eyes out. Such intense relief. And as always I was flooded with emotion about my life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my life. Caught in perpetual pain, always needing help for relief. And see, this exposes just how much pain you hold in you all the time. Accept it loser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so easy to get lost in how much I hate this life, but these sadder thoughts merely float around the core feeling of intense relief. So it's not all that bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dry-needling"&gt;Dry needling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part was scarier than I anticipated. I have had accupuncture. This is not that. This is way more trying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He chose to work on my Quadratus Lumborum. The left needle goes in. That's fine. Tiny thing goes in quick. But then, he wiggles it around and suddenly I feel exactly the muscle, exactly where the needle is and it hurts. A lot. The needle comes out and the pain beings to subside. He continues to press into the area to get those miscles to relax. Yikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards I slowly get up and do some overhead side stretches. Immediately, I am more flexible. So much more I laugh and cry at it. Instead of feeling the pull of my stretch at the attachment points on my muscles I feel the muscle tissue stretching. A distinclty differnt sensation that leaves you feeling good rather than bad. Both of us were amazed the difference one needle gave me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we went back in for a needle in the other side. MY right side hurt a LOT more. I was pulling in, cringing from the pain and crying out because it hurt so intensely. I never cry out from pain. This was hard. And it took a good while longer for the relaxing to occur after. But still the eventuality of it gave me a great comfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a long time laying down afterward feeling this new body I am in. It is not cured. It is not pain free. But the range of movement, the comfort, the filling of my body, and the minimzed intensity of my neural pain is significant, and I am joyus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue seeking treatment like this üòç&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-18:/posts/2018-10-18-dry-needling.html</guid></item><item><title>Going to a support group in Maryland</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-17-md-support-group.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Something I appreciate from everyone I talk to about local support groups for transgender people is how important they are to finding a social circle. The support is nice, but having a place for us all to go so we can meet is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I went to a support group with my friend. There I found a group very similar to the one I spent so much time at. A group growing, sometimes shocked at that size, trying to find ways to support the growth, and a wide variety of expressions and peoples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the meeting I mustered up the courage to tell the whole group a brief sentence about my situation and an invite to get food. I had never done this before. My heart was pounding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I left on this trip I have yet to push myself into new spaces again. This was the first time I was with new trans faces. And I was happily rewarded and comfortable in the face of vulnerability and risk. Four people joined my friend and I for some munch and glug. I was so happy to have the opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-f-u-t-u-r-e"&gt;The F U T U R E&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke with them about my long term goals of finding a way to give back to the trans community. Something I feel I am finally ready to begin forming and putting into my plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have so many ideas in my head about where I might end up. I can feel that this vanlife journey is going to uncover how exactly I will give back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I have thought of so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tucking undergarment product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trans Lifeline operator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fund for laser hair removal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local trans outreach support organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support group fascilitator/organizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homeless shelter / halfway house exclusively for trans people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social instituation for maintaining connections within the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how much of a "in the mud" kind of person when helping people I can't imagine working on higher level things, like legislation, politics, or government. Those things are for different people than I. But who knows, maybe I will evolve into that person over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I hope I do is remember that the focus is not what I want, but what the trans community NEEDS. I am not in this for self indulgence, but for having a real impact on our lives for the better.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-17:/posts/2018-10-17-md-support-group.html</guid></item><item><title>Playing my violin in a park for the first time this year</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-16-violin-in-park.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today was weird and hard. Playing in an open space is so different than the comfort of Vanessa. This wide open park with plenty of people walking through, but very few walking by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played quietly for fear of disturbance. I felt my technical classical pieces were too high class and uppity. But I played them anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt the pressure of needing to be perfect and cringed at my mistakes. I worried I was always out of tune. Thankfully the violin was shifting to the weather and went out of tune itself a lot. OR was it??? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got too cold and my fingers couldn't play well so I played one of the harder songs and quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman from the playground 1000ft afar yelled out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was really beautiful thank you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only person to address me while I played. For someone to yell out like that really calmed me. Thank you person. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-16:/posts/2018-10-16-violin-in-park.html</guid></item><item><title>Chickies Rock County Park PA</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-12-chickies-rock.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;After leaving my grandmother I stopped at the Susquehanna River for the sunset. Here I went exploring a bit, played my violin and chatted with a couple people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One was a mid twenties man studying for a nursing program who enjoyed my music and started a chat. From Iraq originally it was very cool to hear his persepctive on some of the idiosyncrasies of US culture. And he was sweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At sunset I tried to play my violin but it was too darn cold. I didn't play much. But a man with his dog listening was interested in the vanlife and had plans for it so we chatted a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had strong urges to come out to people. To tell them what I am. But I did not. It never was truly relevant to the conversation, and if so, only in a tertiary way. I am not entirely sure why I still feel the urge to tell people all the time. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-12:/posts/2018-10-12-chickies-rock.html</guid></item><item><title>Loving extended family</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-12-extended-family.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am lucky. Very luck I feel. The beginning of my trip has had me visting three different types of extended family. Aunt/Uncle, Cousin and Grandmother. They are all very kind towards me and don't care one bit about my transition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember growing up feeling afraid of all my extended family. There was some light bullying from a few of them, but mostly I was just so afraid fo be myself around them because I felt I didn't really know them. Couple that with how strongly I tended to be an observer and I didn't develop much with my extended family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I am getting the opportunity to meet them, seemingly for the first time, and they've all been wonderful. Instead of feeling trapped in my past, I feel welcomed in the present. I get to see who they all really are, and get to recover further through their generosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aunt and uncle I visited last week were, honestly, a scarier visit at first. While I had seen them for an afternoon this summer I have very few experiences with them. MY fears were mostly based off an old memory of fourth of july about 20 years ago. They were fun people, but also more wild than I was familiar with. Fireworks in the backyard and drinking, and my accidental jello shot just left me feeling guilty and afraid. While they are more energetic, fun people, they are nice as can be, understanding, and easy to be around. And sadly I didn't get to experience that growing up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother is another one that surprised me. And I think I should jsut be learning that all my extended family are going to surprise me haha. She is a wonderful person who has been kind and udnerstanding, wise and with a "real" persepctive on life. Something I experience inside my communities is a very intense idealistic progressive persepctive that, I feel, often doesn't take into account the reality of today. My grandmother can see both sides of it. And in that, has a very awesome perspective. Notably, I went swimming with her. I wore a new bathing suit and went into a women's locker room for the first time. I felt very lucky and comfortable thanks to her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-meaning-of-support-from-extended-family"&gt;The meaning of support from extended family&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know so many trans people who lose a lot of family when they come out. We are taught that family sticks together. And when they don't it hurts real bad. This is why many in the trans community have learned to build chosen families. This is harder still mostly because we are taught that family is somehow better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAving extended family support a trans person is huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it has helped me marry my past life with my current life. I can slowly reintegrate my old memories into the person I am today. I feel less ashamed about my past. I accept myself more today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to finish life without this but it feels pretty darn good to have it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if only I can finish this all up and be a better family member to them. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-12:/posts/2018-10-12-extended-family.html</guid></item><item><title>Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-10-railroad-museum.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I went to see trains with my grandmother! What a cool place. I do wish I had much more time to go over everything as I am learning I really like to soak in this stuff. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-10:/posts/2018-10-10-railroad-museum.html</guid></item><item><title>End of my first visit</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-10-06-first-visit.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I feel pretty good about my first visit. I very quickly purged technology from my mind and focused on the person I was with. We went out for a short hike at the Deleware Water Gap, ate ice cream and watched a tv show, and spent time at the library doing tech things. It was very nice and much more relaxing than the last time I saw my cousin. I am very glad she is doing well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My body is not happy though. The walk and and her uncomfortable furniture left my back aching and I am feeling is after the drive into PA. I definitely feel I am stressing and pushing to be social and see everyone. And what I really want to do is lie down for a week and then finish some stuff in Vanessa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is my one of my mother's brothers. I am looking forward to seeing him and his family because I haven't spent much time with them, and, when we had a short visit this summer it went really well. I really like being around family who are nice and supportive. It has a huge impact on unifying my past with the present. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-10-06:/posts/2018-10-06-first-visit.html</guid></item><item><title>Lunch with an old friend</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-09-24-lunch-with-old-friend.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am so lucky. To have so many people in my life still willing to catch up with me even after I've transitioned. This friend goes back to 2010 when I was in my darkest. Working with the greatest team of people I ever worked with while I couldn't truly enjoy them the way I could now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to write about from this interaction is about my party. I had mentioned I had a going away gathering with people from my support group. I described the setting. Frisbee, bubbles, chalk and sunset. His response was "That's a Luna party of I ever heard of one". Well, he said something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had such a rush of nostalgia, klexos. Ramming old memories into today. See, back then I used to do a lot more bubbles. All kidns of bubbles. Colored, smelly, big, small, huge. I made my own solutions and generally enjoyed bubbles a lot. I also played around with other toys for parties like lasers with patterns, sand that glowed (discontinued üò≠), frisbees. Having these activities was a way for me to displace my anxieties in groups of people so I could focus on an activity and not the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am using these same devices to engage people, bring something more to the experience than the same old, and hopefully remind people how to have childlike fun in this chaotic world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so wild to me how different I am, yet the same. Realizing how much this old friend of mine knows about me isn't moot because of my transition. I am unashamed to be who I am now. All the same things I Wished to bring people back then I still want to bring to people now. It is okay that this is who I am. Not everyone will want need or like I am this way and that is fine. We need all kinds in this world. I can be this goofy hopeful idealistic inspirational nutball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want to point out just how important people like this old friend are for someone like me. Someone who was so repressed, who hid their true self so greatly, who needs to change more about their life than we think others will be comfortable with. To have people from before willing to be around after. People who can help me marry that past life with today's life. Resolution with myself. IT is huge. And it means a lot. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Sep 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-09-24:/posts/2018-09-24-lunch-with-old-friend.html</guid></item><item><title>Talking with a stranger led to a disappointing sexual dismissal</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.life/posts/2018-09-23-convo-gone-sexual.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Walking back to Vanessa from the liquor store, someone with a deep voice said something from behind. I look back. A black man with facial hair, thin, six feet tall with a hoody and a bag from the same liquor store was a few feet away from me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You look sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh nah, I'm just tired I guess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He replies by stating how surprised he was that a white would talk to a black. As I learn more and more about Boston it makes sense that might be his first reaction to my willingness to respond. He seemed friendly, and was being kind. We walked together until I got to Vanessa. I told him this is me, and he asked if we could share a drink for a minute. Sure why not. I got time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vanessa I get my wine bottle open and we sit on her slider door step and chat while we sip alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This went fine, until it didn't. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He began getting sexual with me. I kept turning him down, albeit more gently than I'd have liked. He share some stories with me of his past life which increased my reservations. He went so far as to surprise kiss my neck. After I pushed him away he assumed I liked it because I was squirming. I made it clear it was because I was uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I began getting ready to leave. HE began getting sad. Immediately his flip was switched and he felt dejected and depressed. Yikes. It was hard. I have too much empathy for people, and it was difficult for me to watch all those emotions in him tumble. But I also had to protect myself. Skeevy interaction for sure but a good lesson learned I think. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 23 Sep 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.life,2018-09-23:/posts/2018-09-23-convo-gone-sexual.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
