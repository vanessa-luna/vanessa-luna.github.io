Today I part north.</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2018-01-05-a-social-month.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In the last 38 days, I was social 29 of them. This is a lot for me. I have never spent so much time and energy meeting new people in my life. Van life gave me this month. Van life gave me all the growth I experienced the month of December. Oh and all the cool people I met too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights because of my openness to meeting new people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I performed in a concert!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went busking for the first time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found a boy I was attracted to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found that sexuality doesn't have to hurt as bad as it used to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I realized more confidence than I've ever had before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can now meet new people without anxiety (except cis girls, you scary yo ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel so different about what I am now. What I offer to the world. Who I am willing to be. Who I can be. So shit. Thanks Jacksonville, St Augustine, and Orlando Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never would have changed like this without Vanessa. In the face of so much change, without proximity of friends, I had to push to learn to make new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-3-vanessa"&gt;I &amp;lt;3 Vanessa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside my growth, I saw every single person I met grow too. New confidences found in every one of them. This makes me feel very good. Especially when I can have an impact on my trans sisters. Nothing makes me happier than seeing them grow, and find inner strength and happiness. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what I am now, thanks girl. I am so fucking grateful for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-cold-of-the-north"&gt;The cold of the North&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am beginning my ascent today. In six days time I shall be back in Mass enduring the insufferable hell of winter. Each day I will get colder and colder. And hopefully not depressed along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out for some more posts. I'll have a lot of time to write this week. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-05:/posts/2018-01-05-a-social-month.html</guid></item><item><title>Trip 4: The Fall</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-11-06-the-fall.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I finally departed for my next trip in Vanessa! Took way too long, but after support from my kith and kin I am off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trip I should still make it down to Florida again, but I must return in January. That's the sad part. So this is really, half the fall trip. But that's okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-i-accomplished-this-summer"&gt;What I accomplished this summer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;installed new bright LED light&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;redid wiring for existing lights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix my shoe-rack style organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replaced the blower motor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;re-adhered my ceiling insulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got brand new brake lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm rather proud of my ceiling insulation trick. I found some rather large hex bolts and drove them through the insulation so the head of the bolt faced the floor. Then, I used a magnet on the end of the bold to hold the insulation to the metal ceiling. This creates an air gap about 1/4 - 1/2 inch. So I glued some mylar sheeting onto the insulation I had hoping it might have some effect. Thanks for the idea Brittany!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-summer-learnings"&gt;Other Summer Learnings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thankfully had many experiences this summer, and it's so cool to look back at how much I changed through it. I went on dates! Can you believe that? Me, on a real date. Damn. I worked a lot of my sewing project. And I cannot wait for the spring so I can show it to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a lot more grounding in myself. I think being physical with a few people really helped me with that. I learned just how much physical touch can alleviate my pain. And if I'm not careful I might addicted to it. It is a remarkable feeling, allowing yourself to feel worthy of attention, affection, and pleasure. It was definitely jarring at first though. But now, I can't wait to find out more about how I want physicality in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also truly began to understand why people like me. Oh and truly believing that people see me as a girl. I glimpse more of the reality others see in me. I think this means I am also beginning to accept what I am. I can be this person I was fated to be. And I can direct her story too. I have made some bold statements in the last month I never thought I would ever say. Damn. I am proud of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="food"&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suck at food. I used to hate food, hate eating, and feared eating. So today on my first day, going to the grocery store and not hating the whole process, and feeling empowered in a new way was awesome. I will slowly work myself into a slightly chubby wubbly mess and I'll love it! I can't wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to make sure I get me lots of them fruits and veggies while also stuffing myself with crap. MMMmmmmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rolling-on"&gt;Rolling on&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I am off to visit friends and family for the rest of the month. Then off to Florida for December. See you there :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-11-06:/posts/2017-11-06-the-fall.html</guid></item><item><title>New drawers for Vanessa!</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-09-28-new-drawers-for-vanessa.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;My wonderful friend helped me install new drawers in Vanessa. Totally maximizing some of the space in the rear beneath my bed. I am super excited about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left side, which is empty for now, will hold a removable plastic drawer storage solution. This is so I can continue to remove my long board if I ever use it again. If I didn't have that pesky thing I might have filled the entire rear with drawers. Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="design"&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are basic construction. The drawers are 4 panels glued and screwed together on the sides. The drawer base is inset into the wood 1/8 of an inch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frame is to walls with two small back plates to stop the drawers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reused drawer slides from an old ikea dresser I had. The slides are mounted onto the side walls and inset into the drawers as deep as they can go.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-09-28:/posts/2017-09-28-new-drawers-for-vanessa.html</guid></item><item><title>Vanessa's brakes are fixed!</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-09-26-vanessa-brakes-fixed.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I finally did it. I found the people and got them to fix the brake lines. I am very happy about that. I realize my original estimates of repair costs were extreme. That's partly because the mechanic I found I trust most is at a dealership. Partly because I am essentially out of money and was on my approach to depression. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-09-26:/posts/2017-09-26-vanessa-brakes-fixed.html</guid></item><item><title>Update on Vanessa's brakes</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-09-12-vanessa-brake-update.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I went to another mechanic to ask for quotes about the things my other mechanic suggested. OF course they're willing to do for less, but I'm concerned. I really need to get on this if I'm going to leave for the winter. And yet I'm trolling along like the sun will never set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mechanic, did not give me anything other than a lump sum quote. Which is not what I wanted. I had asked about my outer tie rod and bearings and guess what. They came back with "your ball joints are shot". I brought out the document from Mercedes describing that traditional ball joint tests are not applicable. He cited his 30 years experience and did not fully read over the document. Next time, if I talk to any mechanic about my front end, I'm showing them this. And likely printing out other pertinent comments from the forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When questioning about the brake lines it was a real chore. The guy sucks at communicating and took my curiosity hard, I think. Regardless I left feeling like I had to fight him for information, when all I wanted to understand were the options and what he was planning to do. I don't know who to turn to next. I don't want to have to ride out to Burlington for mechanics. But maybe I should turn to my friend's mechanics. Maybe I should ask my other mechanic about other options he's willing to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'm so hesitant to move forward with this because I want it to fail. I dont' want to take money from others yet I have to if I'm to leave for the winter. Debt. Serious serious debt. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-09-12:/posts/2017-09-12-vanessa-brake-update.html</guid></item><item><title>Is Vanessa dead?</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-09-05-vanessa-is-dead.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I got word from my mechanic about my brake fluid leak. It is catastrophic. Vanessa needs over $4,000 of repairs. I only got one year and three months out of her. Not the two I had hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can hardly process this right now. I feel it's over. I don't think I've mentioned this, and I feel I shouldn't, but I have applied for disability. I am expecting a hearing sometime this winter. What will I do until then? To be stuck in my old car, in my old life, in my childhood house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as of now I need wheel bearings repacked, an outer tie rod, and new brake lines, load sensing valve and load sensing link. All critical things for safety. I cannot go on without repairing these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will never have this money. And even if people in my life want to pay for it I don't think I could accept. How could I. I have already been given so much. If I am awarded disability, I can wait until I save up my own money to fix or replace Vanessa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-09-05:/posts/2017-09-05-vanessa-is-dead.html</guid></item><item><title>Vanessa is leaking brake fluid</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-08-27-brake-fluid-leak.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;HaHAhahaHaHaha. OMG. Perfect. So the brake light came on beeping at us mid day. After thorough investigation I discovered a leak in the rear brake lines. A junction box of some kind is so corroded it's leaking. Well that's my guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After considerable research I threw some more fluid in the reservoir to shut it up and get home.  Argh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No idea yet if this arm is related...&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-08-27:/posts/2017-08-27-brake-fluid-leak.html</guid></item><item><title>Vanessa's drive belt update</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-08-26-belt-progress.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For a couple days now we've dealt with a squeaky belt. It is no surprise the belt it likely too loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The belt doesn't always squeal. Sometimes it does when we first start the engine. Sometimes only after raising the RPMs. Most of the time it is light and goes away quickly. Sometimes is lasts for a quarter mile. It often starts up when I turn on the A/C compressor or when I turn the steering wheel all the way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things lead me to believe that the belt is loose. Temperature, position, and stress on the belt are all factors to how it squeaks. Thankfully it always goes away. But I know that's not a solution, only an acceptance of something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am beginning to think that the tensioner needs replacing. I haven't found a way to adjust it. And it is definitely all the way back. I made sure that it wasn't sticking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So hopefully we make it back to MA with no problems. When I take Vanessa in to change out a dying tie rod I'll ask to see if I did something wrong, or if I'm right about the tensioner. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-08-26:/posts/2017-08-26-belt-progress.html</guid></item><item><title>I fixed Vanessa's pulley and belt ^_^</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-08-22-fixing-vanessa-belt-pulley.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;What a trip. The part came in. I found out there was a small tire change shop that does minimal repairs right across the street. Easy enough to boot up Vanessa and spill over. Let's see if they'll lend us the tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walk over to the tire place. Ask questions about whether they will let us borrow the tools or not. One of the employees, Jeremy, was super nice and even walked over to Vanessa to take a look at her with me. I knew too much, he was grasping a bit. But he said he would let me borrow his tools once we get the part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part acquired we made it over. Jeremy came out and helped us with the right tools. We only needed a T50 bit and a 17mm 12-point socket. And something long to give us leverage. I ended up using an adjustable wrench on the T50 bit because the belt tensioner bar he lent us was too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anywho. Taking the pulley off and on was easy just time consuming because of the narrow space. I didn't take anything off and was fighting the fan blades the whole time. I might have damaged the pulley on the way in though. At on point after most of the bolt was in I got some real tension. I backed off and realized the pulley was not seated properly on the bolt. Once I pushed it up right I could finish tightening it. Did I damage it somehow? IS that why it has a rhythmic wobble in the pulley now? Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The belt took less time but was more annoying. I needed my friend to help. We got the belt around and struggled to get it over the last pulley with the tensioner pulled. I thought it would be easier. And oddly, I was not pulling on the tensioner when my friend finished getting it over the last pulley. And now, it seems the belt may be stretched. IT has give and wobbles rotationally when running. But I've never looked at my belt before this. So what do I know? Did we stretch it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention the fears/concerns because the belt squealed like crazy. More so than I expected. Was it too loose? Did I damage the pulley? Is it the wrong part? Is it just a crappy brand belt? Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustratingly I got exactly the belt and pulley I should have. I researched the shit out of it. After idling Vanessa for a while the belt seemed to give in and squeal less. We drove 120 miles on her to Richmond VA and she did alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUPER PROUD of myself for diagnosing, finding parts, and fixing Vanessa all by myself. A HUGE victory for me. And put me through some suffering I had not anticipated. Can't wait for what's next!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-08-22:/posts/2017-08-22-fixing-vanessa-belt-pulley.html</guid></item><item><title>Stuck in NC, Vanessa's parts are coming</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-08-21-vanessa-update.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In lieu of another day of questions, I opted to order a part through a local parts store. I didn't want to wait until monday for the chance that a dealership or junkyard had the part only to find I had to order the part anyway. So I ordered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are stuck here until at least Tuesday night. Ideally we get back on the road no later than Wed noon time. We have places we wish to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will need to rent or buy the tools to put it together but if this is the only problem, then we'll be off shortly after the parts arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed there's nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-08-21:/posts/2017-08-21-vanessa-update.html</guid></item><item><title>An idler pulley shattered and threw my drive belt. YAY!</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-08-19-tie-rod-ac-failure.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;What a fucking day. First, the A/C just fails. After leaking something through the floor vents for a couple days, the A/C just stops pushing cold air. Leak? Compressor? Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, minutes later we take a tight turn and suddenly the van doesn't want to turn. We pull over immediately. Turns out, the upper idler pulley shattered and threw the drive belt off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully we got in a parking spot at a Wendy's in a commercial area. The staff has been awesome. Even offering us hot water and a free lemonade. The police rolled up the morning after and were totally cool with it, although I was not there while it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After gobs of research it looks like the pulley needs to be ordered. Replacement belt already acquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny part is that I'm fifteen minutes away from a friend who could definitely help, but I'm don't think she's willing to. Maybe the only truly disappointing part of this situation. Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 19 Aug 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-08-19:/posts/2017-08-19-tie-rod-ac-failure.html</guid></item><item><title>Vanessa Failed State Inspection</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-07-14-vanessa-failed-inspection.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I figured she might, but not for this reason. Apparently, both ball joints are "loose".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was livid. I cannot afford something like that. Or maybe better, I don't want to afford something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I zipped home and did some research. Immediately I came upon a document from Mercedes stating that testing Sprinter ball joints the "standard" way, may actually damage them. These suspensions are built differently than normal, and recommends a different approach for testing whether they are damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to be safe I have scheduled an appointment with the Mercedes Dealership I love to have them checked out. I am quite hopeful that they are fine so I can go back to the inspection station with expert opinions on my ball joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they do need replacing, my entire future plan is disrupted. I am not so lucky to have the money to accommodate major failures. I know right? What am I thinking living in such an old van then?! Well I'm pushing my luck. That's what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-07-14:/posts/2017-07-14-vanessa-failed-inspection.html</guid></item><item><title>90 days in Vanessa.</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/posts/2017-06-10-90-days.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have been on the road for 90 days in Vanessa! I wanted to try to write some words about the experience from this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been following my posts you'll know I have gone through a lot on this trip. What has been a mere 3 months, 90 days, of my 10,000+ days alive, I feel I have experienced a major tipping point. Years in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grateful I am to be so privileged to experience this. And happy that this kind of live is so appealing to me. IT makes sense given my history, but there is something, dare I say romantic about being a nomad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of romance, briefly, I had a conversation with a friend about romance. I seem to be very detached from what people normally consider romantic. I believe I used that word in the previous sentence because she may have helped me understand better. But all it takes is a couple of moments for me to dismiss the connection and realize the word I'm really looking for is fantastical. I seem to have distilled the word romance into a form of delusion. For romance is nearly always about an idea, and not reality. And in relationships, romance is dangerous. But I've still yet to find the words to describe what people normally mean when they imply romance.  What an ugly aside. I apologize&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been to so many places and pushed myself to do so many things. Meeting people. Going to breakfast with people I met the day before. Having dinner in a park after rescuing a family's dog at a rest stop. Listening to a man talk about his infidelity. Spending two nights in an empty warehouse unit with another vandweller I just met who helped me change the oil in my van and took me out to dinner on easter. I saw old friends. I climbed a twelve story construction crane. I reached out on communities on the internet to find new friends, and met two! I met an amazing woman who taught me so much in only two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started playing my violin again, after ten years. I played for the setting sun in Key West FL. I played in parks all along the coast. I performed at a local cafe open mic. I stopped in NC to buy a stove from a man off criagslist, and he was so enamored with my life I offered to play a song for he and his wife. I read poetry, twice, and open mic nights. I sparked a random conversation with a man carrying a u-bass in a violin case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fixed the blower motor in my van, twice. I changed it's oil. I added new decorations. I learned how to treat her rust. I broke some vent fins. I installed a cigratte lighter power port in the cabin by splicing wires. I soldered my own vanity lights for my visor mirror. Soldred my own y-splitter for powering my overhead LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I became real. I know most of you won't understand just how important this is. But It's HUGE. And I know this post is boring. What a list machine eh? Well. I don't really care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have so much coming in the next season. As Summer is about to crash this party, I cannot wait to be productive. But still I am timid about my return. Am I really real enough? Stable enough in this new perspective to keep going and not regress? Fuck I hope so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To another 90 days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;3 Vanessa&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-06-10:/posts/2017-06-10-90-days.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
