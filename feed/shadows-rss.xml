I've got so much recovery under my belt I'm seen as a poster. I pass regularly and blend in always. I recovered from lifelong DPDR and anxiety. I survived suicide. I quit my life and became nomadic. I reconnected with music and art. I quickly bond with others while being truthful. I quit smoking. I have friends and family who take care of me. On the outside my life looks good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still stuck with my chronic pain. Whole body arthritis is exhausting, especially when hrt makes it worse. My never sense of identity from DPDR has made all progress on expression a bust. I've learned to cope with the pain but only by living so deeply in the moment I am unable to function in society. My empathy and lack of identity have created a great mirror. I am this example of recovery and happiness while trans because that is who I want others to have the chance to see. Underneath lies nothing. A collection of perspectives and a toolkit for Socratic reasoning. I do the bare minimum to survive so I can go on helping others. But don't mistake it for unhealthy behaviors. Trust me if I had a self to show the world I would have done it by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished my bucket list. The one I started six years ago. I've helped more people in my lifetime than most ever will. Dedicated years to a support group and helping lift others up. Especially my trans siblings. I got to experience love as a girl. I had a successful career where my efforts largely contributed to an acquisition. I've seen many places and marveled at the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm done. I want out. What's left? Understand this is mostly about my physical health, but no small portion to dysphoria either. I can't function like this forever. But I'm stuck like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried to create values out of thin air. To find ways of holding on to life for a myriad of reasons. As it stands, the only reason I feel MY life is worth living, is to help others. It is the single most valuable currency I have, and the only purpose I can realistically fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### What should I do now?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-02-06:/s/posts/2018-02-06-what-left.html</guid></item><item><title>Will I step up again?</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/s/posts/2018-02-05-stepping-up.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today is a bad day. Attempting to plan my next trip, finish up tasks, all in the cold of winter. I am not doing well. I thought I was going to have this figured out by March, it will now take until maybe July. This extra three months is fucking with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost called someone for support. I almost broke down. But I didn't. Why? Because I can't. I can't let anyone see me express suicidality ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck. It's funny how writing it down, and then reading it back jolts me. If my family or close friends ever read this they would be horrified. I hate how I will effect them all should I ever end up dying.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-02-05:/s/posts/2018-02-05-stepping-up.html</guid></item><item><title>I guess I'm not so sneaky</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/s/posts/2018-02-03-not-so-sneaky.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently spent time with someone I only interacted with a few times before I began my nomadic life. While catching up I learned something I never considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, they were worried about me before I left. So, telling everyone you're going on a long trip can... trip up certain people who are aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was doing a great job with most people hiding my true intentions. I guess I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still processing this information. It hangs me heavy, that's for sure. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 03 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-02-03:/s/posts/2018-02-03-not-so-sneaky.html</guid></item><item><title>Wishing to leave and hoping to stay</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/s/posts/2018-01-25-leaving-and-loving.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I want to leave this life. I really do. For all that I could be, what's left due to chronic pain is so disappointing. The people I want most to be with are people I would only hold back. I don't want to ruin someone's life by letting them get sucked in to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it appears I am finding some acceptance of this story. So long as I focus my life on supporting others I can still go on right? Fuck the cis people. All I need to know is my trans siblings are closer to happy than yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I want to figure it out. I want to find a way to live without suicide. I want to have people in my life on a regular basis. I want to feel I can contribute and make someone's life undeniably better. I don't know if I want a life long partner, but I am curious to find out if I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only follow the path in front of me. And I know it is not over yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-25:/s/posts/2018-01-25-leaving-and-loving.html</guid></item><item><title>Ugh dysphoria and cis envy</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/s/posts/2018-01-18-dysphoria.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am what I am, I am who I am, and I can only change so much at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why I generally avoid life and society altogether. I live in a van, travel, avoid as much social media as I can, and spend a lot of time searching for other trans people to meet up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I found myself in a corner of youtube that suggested these creative, feminine, singer songwriter girls. I felt like shit afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is a problem for me. And it's likely why my whole life is designed around helping trans people. So I can fucking avoid the cissies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because when envy strikes, it's like a shortcut right to suicidality. Dysphoria comes rolling in. Flashes of lightning cascade through the valley. The moment between desperation and action feeling smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if I will ever truly conquer this. Or if I will die once my duties fulfilled. Would it even matter either way?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-18:/s/posts/2018-01-18-dysphoria.html</guid></item><item><title>Dreaming in pain</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/s/posts/2018-01-02-dreaming-in-pain.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;What a remarkable thing. Dreaming in pain. This never used to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waking in a warm bed, my lower half aching, my shoulders crinkling, my heart at the  bottom of a pit from my dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sit again wondering when I will get this life over with. When I will finish my bucket list so I can end this. And why I seem to think I will still want to follow through with ending my life after I live through it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few short chilly days I will be driving north into the hell of winter. For at least two weeks I will be trapped, trying my hardest to not get sucked into the dark depression of frigid tense hell. And I'll need to borrow more money in order to get back south after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want this hell over with.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2018-01-02:/s/posts/2018-01-02-dreaming-in-pain.html</guid></item><item><title>Pansexuality</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/s/posts/2017-12-11-attraction.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This trip has taught me a lot about who I am attracted to. What I am willing to do, and how I feel about myself. I am amazed at what I've discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly am a pansexual kind of human. Someone where gender does not play a significant role in who I am attracted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are still so many kinds of people I have not had experiences with, I am certain my enjoyment from physical experiences comes not from some sort of internal identity satisfaction with a type, but connecting with the human in front of me, who's trying just as I am, to be human and authentic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluntly, I am still afraid of vaginas. I am worried about envy and dysphoria. However I am getting so much better at expressing certain needs at the outset so I don't do things I really won't do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so happy to finally be understanding myself. I can't wait to see where I end up. &lt;em&gt;WHAT?!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, so I had a sexy experience this night. And guess what... I ORGASMED. For the first time. First girl orgasm. I am elated. I can't wait for more. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-12-11:/s/posts/2017-12-11-attraction.html</guid></item><item><title>Let the anger flow</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/s/posts/2017-11-27-anger.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I fucking hate this life. I suck at being a friend to the healthy and happy. Because I have nothing to offer to others. All of my existence is focused on my recovery and staying away from the darkness. So all I have to give is hope and bullshit support. I am nothing more compelling as a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else is there to give as a friend? To all those who are mostly fine with life, or at least stay away from the existential questions of life but for a few moments here and there, I wish I knew how to befriend you. Your normality is enviable. I wish I had a sense of identity, a sense of continuity of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to be a well of windows, ever drifting through realities, always grasping for my own, which, while in sight, is never anchored. I try so deeply to have an island of my own that's worth visiting. But my island is smothered in hope-phrases, trap pits, and waterfalls of sadness. To let you see my world is to see a life ready for death. Patiently completing her bucket list so she can tell everyone "See! I lived my fucking life, so let me die, please!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My whole life is a fucking lie. My entire life was a game of pretend. I was nothing of myself. And so, as soon as I knew I was going to break off that path and attempt for authenticity, I had my bucket list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I fucking end it once I finish it. I hope I don't waver. It would break my heart.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-11-27:/s/posts/2017-11-27-anger.html</guid></item><item><title>Hollow habits</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/s/posts/2017-11-08-hollow-habits.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I don't know why this is a shadow. But it is. I am empty feeling. In the sense that I see just how much of my time is spent following hollow habits. Empty nothings that waste my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fighting the urge to browse the internet, watch videos, and play video games. These three things are how I escape. And shit I can dump so much time into them for no good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I'm reminded of how often the only other choice I have is reading a book. Bed ridden and trying desperately to stay sane inside my pain, what else can I do? Unfortunately all I have been reading is self-help/educational books. And I can only read so much of those at a time. Literally. Too much and I don't soak in the message. So maybe I need to figure out my fiction niche... young adult female coming of age books? Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll suck someone into a super long convo just to waste time. So I truly appreciate the connections with others. I can't wait to get better at enjoying moments with people silently, showing emotion towards people who inspire it, and expressing physicality in a whimsical way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the pain I'm feeling now is inspiring this as a shadow. Maybe I don't want to be seen as over-posting so I hide this one a bit. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-11-08:/s/posts/2017-11-08-hollow-habits.html</guid></item><item><title>Life is indiscriminate</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/s/posts/2017-10-26-all-kinds.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The universe is free to experience any kind of all kinds that it can. This means that all forms of death will and can occur. All forms of stories will find a way at one time or another. Some people die from old age, some of cancer, accidents, heart failure, murder, and suicide. That is okay. That is not tragic. It merely is. Trying to categorize the tragic weight of one kind of death over another should lead to the idea that all death is tragic, and therefore it is also not tragic. The choice is yours in how you see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult for me to start there and continue on. In one hand I'd like to talk about how I hope my death comes at my own hand; for any other option would seem like running from it. On the other hand, I want to write about how this very abstraction, is what allows for a person like me to exist. This empathic, loving, tranny wrapped in pain and lack of identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like admitting here, for some reason, a level of my truth I so rarely speak of. So I hope only a few choice people stumble across these shadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bucket-list"&gt;bucket list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I'm going to be stuck in chronic pain my whole life I might as well stop hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been living off a bucket list since I began my transition. It all began here. I added a few items onto the last, a list of three basic elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;share as much as I can because people seem to value it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do as much as I can for others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;experience as much of life as you can, as a girl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scary part is how close I am to finishing this list. After almost six years I have only two left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will die happy after I complete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what will happen once this list is finished. I have not added to this list in over three years. And I am slated to complete it in the next two years. When I get there I imagine the final confluence dumping into the vast ocean. Suddenly, there will be no rails. No guide. No purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A part of me wants to set a pact that if I am still in pain by then, to end my life. Another part wants me to set no plans and see what comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will live in this responsibility forever. For that is what I am and what I must be. People say to accept yourself. That is what I am doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-10-26:/s/posts/2017-10-26-all-kinds.html</guid></item><item><title>The life I could have had versus this fucking thing</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/s/posts/2017-10-21-the-life-i-could-have-had.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am not shy about admitting how much envy I hold in my heart. Envy has been a best friend for my whole life. Maybe if I could let go of it, I could look forward without a mouthful of sawdust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I tried to uncover what I was hiding over five years ago, I knew, I felt how much of who I should have been was lost. All those years trapped in that hell sucked me farther and farther away from my self. I saw all my relationships built on false foundations, vapid connections, all because I could not be who I am. But now who I can never be who I should have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine, say that this is who I should have been because this is who I am. Well Fuck that. I have been stripped of identity in a way that most humans will never know. Then, when I try to discover that identity I find I must now live in more physical pain. Like the universe is saying "Nuh uh. You don't get to be happy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still grieving. I don't know how long this is going to take. Maybe this will be the last one before I can finally let go of envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who am I kidding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't ever get out of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My past, my future, is all caretaking and suffering. All the joy I feel is fabricated for the sake of others. So other people can experience a jolly person in their day. So others can feal some hope in their life. Does that make it real for me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate this life. I can't wait until it's over.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-10-21:/s/posts/2017-10-21-the-life-i-could-have-had.html</guid></item><item><title>A different kind of alone</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/s/posts/2017-10-14-a-different-kind-of-alone.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Something, so starkly different lines the void in my heart right now. A bleak lens focused on pitiful pats and fleeting lights. Without the false hope of rekindled flames I am now forced to face my prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I may write here is steeped in bias, stereotypes, and anecdotes, but so would any other perspective. The only true thing is my possibilities are endless, but most unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="who-ive-had-to-become"&gt;Who I've had to become&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew years ago, I had to leave everything if I am to hope at becoming real. I did it. I live a nomadic, vagabond, outskirts kind of life because I am not suited for any other. I rot within cultural normities. The confluence of my biggest issues has driven who I am allowed to become. I fight upstream, fuck do I fight upstream. I don't want to succumb to this raging river. But there is only so much I can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent years in a support group because my greatest social value is hope giving; a gift my kith have pulled out of me my entire life. I struggle to maintain real friendships because I cannot turn off therapist mode. I work on my gaff project as an extension of my empathic qualities: If I cannot save my own life, I hope to help save others. I live in Vanessa because I am best served as a temporary entity. I come into your life, show you light, and hopefully lift your soul. Too much of me, and you'll be crushed by my lack of identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tagline of this site has real meaning for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reflection of your experience: as moonlight is a reflection of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personality you see from me, is a direct extension of your own. I exemplify the very things you need the most, and provide insights for you to ponder. The moon light you see in Luna is not moon light. It is sunlight reflected. Your sunlight. your sun. Put me in a large group and I shut down because I have nothing to offer a group. I seek no attention. My desire is to do as little as possible to not make it worse. I become a raw example of a wallflower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-i-might-have"&gt;What I might have&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People seem to love me, and easily. And maybe one day I may find myself healthy enough to find a person I can create a bridge with. I hope I don't destroy it before it starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I change all the time now. I'm barely real. I suppose I should celebrate intensely on my next birthday. After writing to this point I find the hope piling back into my heart. I cannot finish the original darkness which spawned this post. I don't have to, not for my sake at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cry though, for all the crappy people I will meet in my life. The people who fetishize me, objectify me, tokenize me, disrespect me and speak condescendingly to me. The people who want so badly to be the person who can love a trans person, only to leave seeking normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cry for all the fear I must fight with public bathrooms, less accepting areas, attraction to any cis person, the medical industry, the police, employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cry because all I want is to be a waffle, but I will always be french toast. I want so badly to be a waffle. I wish I could rip out my past in myself and my family so I could simply be who I should have always been. I feel I can see who I would have been so clearly. But I cannot be that person. In large part because my hormone treatment has caused such intense physical pain. The burden of a constant reminder that you are forever fucking french toast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fuck"&gt;Fuck&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope, I have the will to live the rest of my life so fast, so bright, so recklessly, so the universe can kill me. There's no other point to my story. All I cared about before I came out to myself was helping others. Then I spend half a decade caring for myself, only to realize I am the most hated, suicidal, minority, and transitioning brought on so much more physical pain. So I go back to caring about everyone else. This with a little more concern for myself. But fuck I want life to kill me. So fucking bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I ever kick this feeling? Is it possible for me? I reall hope not.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luna Umbra</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:vanessa-luna.github.io,2017-10-14:/s/posts/2017-10-14-a-different-kind-of-alone.html</guid></item><item><title>Grieving patiently</title><link>https://vanessa-luna.github.io/s/posts/2017-10-06-grieving-patiently.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I shouldn't be writing about this here. But I am. Grieving is tough. Grief can be so consuming you forget there was life outside it. And in some ways it really is easier to stay inside grief. Never Let Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's fascinating me in this moment, is how differently I process grief now. In most cases, I see grief as a sign I am on my way to letting go. If I was not grieving, then I didn't start the process yet. I would still be stubbornly holding on to something. Unwilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fine. When I'm not fine, I am learning something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resonates so deeply within me now. Thankfully, I truly believe in the power of this phrase. Grief, sadness, crying, over something is a sign I will most likely let go of it. Seeing it in these terms helps me find something to let go of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had to admit to an old love that I could not stop fantasizing about a possible reuinion. For a few years we have been spending time together. Since the beginning, I knew my projections were unhealthy and unfounded. But I could not figure out where they came from or why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-theories-were-shit-at-best"&gt;My theories were shit at best.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only after talking with them about it did I discover their root. I wanted a chance to show them what it would have been like dating the real me. Not some fucking shadow. If they could have loved me as a shadow certainly they could love me now right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact every major relationship I had, I fantasized about and revisited in this way. And in every case I ended up befriending them. Maybe partly because I really want to show them what I am like. Partly because I still really like them. Partly because their friendship helps marry my past and present in such a powerfully healing way I could not have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yet-here-i-am-still-crying"&gt;Yet here I am still crying.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crying over that lost chance of knowing what that relationship could have been like if I had been real. Crying for days off and on. Knowing that this is part of a process really changes grief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting go is not fun. Letting go is hard.
